establish model in industrial innovation
after its competitor invent the front load wash machine , the ceo of the NE_country-0 NE_company-0 company believe that each of its employee have the ability for innovation , and formulate strategic countermeasure for innovation in the industry .
1. establish an innovation fund with a maximum amount of -CONST--0 NE_country-0 dollar .
2. choose -CONST--0 innovative concept to encourage employee to conduct research and development during their work time or spare time .
3. from among them , pick out -CONST--0 for submission to an assessment committee to assess .
since the NE_earthquake-0 , the start point for construction standard in the mainland be that under an earthquake of the same magnitude , building should preserve their basic frame without collapse .
however , most of the building in this hard @-@ hit area do not meet these requirement , with the widespread collapse of school building in particular arouse intense public disgust .
raise standard to in excess of NE_earthquake-0 's -CONST--0 magnitude could leave authority with some breathe space for explanation , and alleviate public anger .
accord to information leak from numerous channel , we can say for certain that before the earthquake struck , the serious earthquake risk in the NE_local-region-0 be already well know to the NE_political-party-0 .
although current forecast standard cannot give us an accurate prediction of the exact time , place , and strength of an earthquake , there be considerable experience accumulate both in NE_country-0 and overseas in predict to within the timeframe of -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , and the area of a province .
in region where the earthquake risk be high , warn the public and spread disaster prevention awareness could greatly reduce casualty during earthquake ; this be the very minimum duty that any responsible ENT_government-organization-0 should undertake .
in the past the NE_political-party-0 have do a lot of these sort of thing , but on this occasion not only do nothing , but in response to query from the public pull out some whop lie , play syntax game with word like " geological disaster " and " earthquake disaster ".
i think that if our NE_government-organization-0 have be able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquake on this NE_mountain-0 earthquake belt , then on that day of -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , once the NE_government-organization-1 have measure the quake at a magnitude of -CONST--2 , we would have be able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone .
if the simulation program be well design , circumstance like debris block road , heavy rainfall obstruct parachute drop , power and communication outage should all have be within expectation .
instead in this instance the NE_military-0 headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously be not a contingency plan design with earthquake as the assume condition , as the soldier all rush straight to NE_county-0 , without immediately send out troop in the direction of badly @-@ hit area NE_city-0 , NE_city-1 and NE_province-0 's NE_city-2 ; only -CONST--0 hour later be the full extent of the disaster area take into consideration .
in addition , the breakdown in communication also bring a serious problem to the surface . in the past , NE_military-0 regiment be able to maintain contact with central headquarters by relying on just -CONST--0 batter radio . on this occasion though , people have no way to deal with the communication failure .
it be clear that preparation prior to the event be not construct on the basis of an earthquake disaster simulation .
while it should have be a disaster relief command that take overall leadership , it have suddenly come face @-@ to @-@ face with the broad base of disaster victim , directly deal with them .
the lack or serious shortage of intermediate layer of party organization and unit between the -CONST--0 have result in its inability to consider major issue with endless minor issue on hand , such that even if it be highly capable , it won't last long , as it will be drag down by numerous petty thing .
this would have be unimaginable during the NE_earthquake-0 . a time without volunteer or mental worker , such petty thing as directly deal with average people be perform by the most primary party branch , as well as enterprise and public institution .
as soon as the earthquake occur , grass @-@ root organization contact their own people and average people also contact their own system or department , in an interdependent manner .
under the centralized leadership of higher @-@ level organization , everyone act to make the rescue effort very outstanding and successful , such that the NE_earthquake-0 , which happen just a few year ago , be forget all together in the subsequent reform and open @-@ up .
it be obvious that no social or political problem be leave then , nor be sequelae that cause headache to later generation .
during a time of prosperity and happiness , such a big earthquake suddenly struck .
many people die , much property be destroy , it be quite clearly a great disaster .
but it be not totally without benefit , and i believe that its greatest benefit be that it serve to strip off the false benevolence that compose the outer skin of the elitist , the politician , the capitalist , and expose once and for all the rotten cannibalistic core within .
and an additional benefit be that many people who have be delude came to their sense .
temporarily lay aside these abstract thing and avoid speak at length , say only a few detail that leave the elitist , the politician and capitalist highly embarrass .
the expert have just finish say " sacrifice yourself to help others be a foolish idea ", when the leader have no choice but to call once again for selfless devotion .
this be mere chicanery , to the point where before engaging in life @-@ save , donation to charity , these sort of behaviors , an idea have to be flash through people 's mind :
am i be foolish in do this ?
and when people see on NE_publication-0 those private firm manufacture tent in NE_province-0 and NE_province-1 work overtime to produce more tent , the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 idea that popped to mind -CONST--0 'm afraid was probably " this time these capitalist have struck it big ! "
" ENT_amr-unknown-0 be it that these capitalist instead of those capitalist get the big order form , surely there could n't be anything fishy involve ?
during this process , there be again talk about file a complaint against the NE_company-0 .
the reason for file the complaint be that even if we owe their hourly fee , they still should fulfill their obligation on the contract they sign : drive people from NE_city-0 back to NE_city-1 .
as long as we stick to this issue , NE_company-0 surely have no way of win the lawsuit if it go to court .
however , what greatly surprise me be the attitude of the student union in this appeal . they seem very reluctant to make the contract public .
they even lie , say that they and NE_company-0 initially feel that sign a contract would rather make each other feel like stranger since they be both do it for the sake of the motherland .
as you know , this type of logic absolutely won't work in NE_country-0 .
NE_company-0 accept this order of ours and deploy all the bus of other travel agency in NE_city-0 .
without the guarantee from the contract sign with us , they would surely have be unable to deploy them !
in addition , there be something else that be very suspicious .
i hear from a friend at the consulate that the ENT_government-organization-0 take this matter very seriously and have promptly agree to allocate fund to -CONST--0 .
yesterday afternoon i go back to check out the torch relay , but even the flame be practically impossible to see , let alone the guy carry the torch .
there be so many people there it be frighten . some have even climb onto the roof of bus !
i head straight for the center of activity , but in actual fact traffic be be control as early as -CONST--0 o'clock , and they have already start limit the crowd enter the sport center .
some guy be really insane , band together in group and yell out " go NE_country-0 ! "
i actually have some other classmate there , and be go to call them .
i guess the carry capacity of the base station tower be totally overload , and i could n't get through at all . i be only able to find a signal , not a chance of connect to the internet .
only -CONST--0 phone call i make there get through - that be call home .
i have a look at my call register , and out of -CONST--0 of call dialed only -CONST--1 be properly connect !
sometime after -CONST--0 -CONST--1 go straight back home to watch it on tv . the spectacle be just as astonish on tv , except that it be just -CONST--2 angle of the whole thing .
next time i won't be partake in this kind of activity ! !
NE_person-0 's experience of be under public condemnation underscore to a certain extent the tense relationship between the rich and poor class in NE_country-0 society ;
because as NE_country-0 grow prosperous day by day , the gap of wealth between the successful elite and the remain -CONST--0 people be widen .
-CONST--0 year ago , people have basically the same income , which be all deplorably meager .
however , NE_publication-0 ) show that by -CONST--0 , there be a total of 106 billionaires ( in u.s. dollar ) in NE_country-0 , with the number of people only next to that of the NE_country-1 .
now , NE_person-0 say , these response have have effect on me .
he admit that he be not sensitive enough to the current situation when he write his blog .
NE_person-0 note additionally that since NE_country-0 currently have not yet establish a sound system of social security insurance , the grow hatred of the rich be unavoidable .
on tuesday , NE_company-0 announce that it would make an additional donation of rmb -CONST--0 yuan for the temporary resettlement and post @-@ disaster reconstruction in the next -CONST--1 to -CONST--2 year .
NE_person-0 , the basketball player who be hail as a national hero thank to his success in establish himself in NE_league-0 , be also blame after he announce his donation of rmb -CONST--0 yuan because a rumor on the internet allege he have donate -CONST--1 NE_country-0 dollar for disaster relief of NE_natural-disaster-0 ( hurricane ) in -CONST--2 .
even so , donation behavior and the treatment of donation behavior should not deviate from -CONST--0 principle , namely that it be voluntary and do not seek return . otherwise , the donation lose its original mean .
in actual fact , whether it be mcdonalds or any other foreign own enterprise in NE_country-0 on the so @-@ call " NE_thing-0 " blacklist , they all give generously to the cause of help the disaster victim , exhibit their social responsibility .
even if by comparison some company really do n't donate a huge amount , they should not be besiege or subject to verbal violence in the arena of public opinion .
donate , after all , be not a legal obligation that company must carry out . urge business to donate apart from the force of moral consideration should not take the form of any other coercive mean .
as long as a company 's source of income be legal , any compulsory payment outside of legal obligation be a kind of theft .
even in an abnormal circumstance such as disaster relief , legal order and the right bestow upon by law should be respect .
if we be unfortunate enough to be unable to avoid become a disaster victim , we can at least preserve the nobility and dignity of humanity and not turn into rabble .
the lawsuit propose by NE_person-0 do not have a clear subject of the right of action ; moreover it do not satisfy the legal requirement for libel .
for example , he fail to clarify whether NE_person-0 's comment be an argument over opinion or an act of spread an untruthful statement .
the malicious intent of NE_person-0 have not be establish , either . more importantly , he have be unable to offer anything as to how to establish the damage to the -CONST--0 NE_country-0 people .
in addition , in his complaint , it be say that NE_country-0 people have already express their displeasure through demonstration .
here it be a country with the freedom of speech .
on the issue of libel , court only support those who have actually suffer damage and have no other way to seek justice .
therefore , it be very hard for the ENT_government-organization-0 , politician , and public figure to get legal protection on the issue of libel ,
because they have the capability to clear themselves of " smear ."
if you have already clear your own reputation through legal protest , for example , NE_country-0 people be not goon and thug , then a lawsuit be meaningless .
remember , a lawsuit for libel be only to clear your name and get compensation .
after NE_person-0 put forth the " NE_thing-0 ", due to mainland countrymen be deceive by the NE_political-party-0 's propaganda machine , many people advocate use force to unite NE_country-0 .
because they have no understand whatsoever of the situation in NE_country-0 and the will of the NE_country-1 people ,
they universally exhibit extreme nationalistic sentiment .
just like the love @-@ hate fusion of nationalistic war sentiment that erupt after the NE_country-0 mistakenly bomb the NE_country-1 embassy .
they similarly do not understand the real story in NE_country-0 .
but NE_city-0 people realize that first there be the NE_country-0 , only after that come " NE_country-1 ";
while this " NE_thing-0 " have purely and simply be dream up by the NE_political-party-0 .
NE_person-0 be do nothing but bring an already exist phenomenon to light .
moreover , the grand old men of the NE_political-party-0 ENT_amr-unknown-0 hand over on a silver platter a huge chunk of land in NE_country-region-0 north of the NE_river-0 to NE_country-0 , ENT_amr-unknown-1 give away land equivalent to -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of national territory in northern NE_country-1 ; ENT_amr-unknown-2 not take this back , instead of insist on try to grab back a NE_country-2 in the hand of NE_country-3 people ?
however , even though NE_city-0 people have their grumble , the " NE_thing-0 " have in no way trigger a sentimental attachment in hong kong people for " NE_country-0 ".
i believe that our build industry here have not yet reach this level .
not only have the law not yet reach this level , but the average person 's understand have generally not reach this level .
some official , out of local economic consideration , by accident or design be frequently too lenient in deal with property agent .
we all saw the damage wreak by the NE_earthquake-0 .
as to how much of this be a result of natural disaster , and how much be man @-@ make calamity , a verdict will be draw in the end .
apparently , quality check in the space industry be extremely rigorous , each part undergo several inspection process , every effort be make to ensure absolute safety .
but space ship accident still happen from time to time .
even such technologically advance nation as the NE_country-0 have experience several instance of space flight launch or return failure .
since thing can still go wrong even when they be subject to incredibly rigorous inspection as in the space industry , then , with our current " dark " and corrupt property industry the way it be , people 's life be even harder to place guarantee on .
once a powerful earthquake strike , the people 's life really do become as tiny as those of ant .
it make one tremble even without fear .
follow the NE_earthquake-0 this time , there be compatriot who struggle out of the debris , wipe their tear and bury the body of their family , but they brace up again and declare to the world , " we be not beat down ; we be on our feet again ; the earthquake cannot shake the staunch will of the NE_country-0 people ; trial and tribulation serve only to revitalize a nation ! "
this enable us to see the fight spirit of the dauntless NE_country-0 nation give off a dazzle radiance among people in disaster @-@ hit area .
the fact that these word be speak by compatriot who have be through the disaster have give us , who could n't help our tear at the sight of their mishap , so much comfort and encouragement . it give us a hint that no force can beat down the NE_country-0 people .
however , the word later reappear somewhere else and from someone unusual , which i think about for a few day . -CONST--0 feel , for some unknown reason , it be somewhat scary !
i just want to say , let there be no more disaster , so that NE_country-0 be safe and sound from now on and disaster be far away from NE_country-1 .
i pray to the NE_person-0 to open his eye and do n't let disaster visit the NE_country-0 land again !
we do n't want to revitalize the nation through trial and tribulation ,
but rather we want to revitalize the nation by pass our day safe and sound !
-CONST--0 important reason that a great number of people bury or trap in debris in the NE_earthquake-0 @-@ hit area be save be that they be full of hope and firmly believe the NE_military-0 would come to their rescue !
to settle victim , -CONST--0 of tent that stretch mile be soon set up , which contain public toilet , shop , and primary school and middle school .
-CONST--0 or even million of those displace by the disaster have gradually have a home to shelter from the wind and rain !
if everything be put in the market , such that all the land be sell to syndicate or farm owner , then ENT_amr-unknown-0 should the ENT_government-organization-0 set up tent ?
do they expropriate the land on the spot ?
even the ENT_government-organization-0 cannot override the market !
support the disaster @-@ hit area have test our competence , while the ENT_government-organization-0 's ability to rule also stand the trial !
at critical moment , the rule foundation --- worker and farmer , show staunch support to the ENT_government-organization-0 !
if everything be put in the market , such that worker and farmer would have their fate control by the market and no long count on or rely on the ENT_government-organization-0 by walk onto a path of the so @-@ call " find the market rather than the mayor ( ENT_government-organization-1 ) ," then ENT_amr-unknown-0 power would the ENT_government-organization-2 have ?
the post @-@ catastrophe hyperinflation as expect by foreigner have not come either !
the ENT_government-organization-0 have human and financial capital under control , as well as energy and resource !
for example , the value of " seize the pleasure of the moment " also have a long history .
" sing a song when thou have wine , seize the day since life be short." some people in contemporary time think we should " satisfy and die ."
some people have go so far on the road that they " don't know how to eat or play , "
and other take nude picture and flaunt them online .
for another example , the pursuit of office title and level can also be trace back to the old day .
in ancient time there be NE_person-0 to distinguish the order of hierarchy and nobility , construct a pyramid @-@ like social organizational structure .
the NE_person-0 wore different clothe than others . the color of a door and the number of caldrons use for meal be all symbol to distinguish the hierarchy and nobility of people .
the aim be to settle dispute , stop fight and stabilize the society .
however , simultaneously it have also establish a system that value life accord to office level , which to the contrary trigger contention and destabilized the society .
yet no matter how many change of dynasty there be , the value system have always be carry on .
higher or lower rank in NE_dynasty-0 be distinguish by bird and animal pattern on clothe , NE_location-0 use the size and color of a sedan chair as the symbol to distinguish between different rank , and modern people use the motor vehicle displacement as a symbol to distinguish between different position , all of which can be trace to the same origin .
i do n't care how much NE_person-0 waste every time he climb a mountain , but i do strongly despise how -CONST--0 talk and the way -CONST--1 act during this whole thing .
after donate , he suggest that charity should not be the burden of business , and therefore stipulate that his company 's employee donation should not exceed -CONST--0 yuan .
totally absurd logic . NE_person-0 's reason be that make donation to charity then the burden of business could cause company to fail in market competition ;
but we can see such philanthropist as NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 have not affect the growth of their enterprise in any way . instead , they have actually increase the competitiveness of their company .
and there be some netizens who hit back in the NE_person-0 donation issue by admonish us for forcing donation on moral ground .
exactly ! an excellent justification !
if you say that netizens rebuke NE_person-0 be force donation , then ENT_amr-unknown-0 kind of behavior be NE_person-1 prevent employee from donate more than -CONST--0 yuan ?
NE_person-0 be the economic version of a cold @-@ blood animal , and we do n't care ,
but ENT_amr-unknown-0 come NE_person-0 , ENT_amr-unknown-1 come he want to restrict what employee do or do n't do on moral ground ?
this really be a case of one rule for some , another rule for everyone else ! !!
we see , as at -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , the NE_country-0 ENT_government-organization-0 have accept up to -CONST--2 in disaster @-@ relief donation domestically and internationally , of which -CONST--3 be from domestic donor .
what we can see now be merely the name and figure of each donor constantly list in what be like an honor roll .
yet unfortunately , we do n't have more detail information of the whereabouts and specific use of the donate fund .
as corruption have long be prevalent among local ENT_government-organization-0 and economic audit be not transparent enough , disaster @-@ relief fund be often appropriate , exhaust , expropriate and embezzle .
therefore , once such a huge amount of disaster @-@ relief fund from people the world and NE_country-0 be embezzle or otherwise partially transfer by local official , the result political damage and lower of the ENT_government-organization-0 's image domestically and internationally will completely negate the positive image brought by the government 's -CONST--0 effort .
if the donation be directly put in the hand of disaster @-@ hit people , it would push local price higher , drive the already high inflation to a direction that be even harder to regulate .
it be say that our country 's earthquake forecast be at an advanced level in the world .
but the glory of the earthquake worker do not produce good luck for the depart spirit of NE_county-0 .
so , we again hear expert figure emphasize once again , " earthquake forecast be a global challenge that so far no one have be able to solve ."
consequently , we come to realize that the academic laurel for " the success rate of prediction of impend earthquake that have already reach almost -CONST--0 %" be just condition and capital use to apply for fund , evaluate professional title and seek remuneration , rather than a hard rationale use to reduce bloodshed and death .
we should offer earthquake worker our full understand .
face the caprice of nature , humankind be really insignificant .
furthermore , although our sense of security increase with each pass day in line with " significant advance achieve " in seismology , we cannot look to anyone to give us any promise .
because , once someone have make a promise , he would be doom thereafter to bear this bloody weight of " be unable to effectively avoid earthquake disaster ."
and by not issue any promise , he could actually avoid be censure .
because " there be no way to make prediction "!
human can manufacture tank that be much more powerful than ant , but human cannot manufacture a live ant...
however advance instrument manufacture by human be , -CONST--0 level of complexity cannot compare with a section of a toad 's nerve .
do not regard earthquake prediction as a " practical skill "; rather regard it as academic work in a study .
take no notice of the real result in term of prevent earthquake or minimize disaster ; rather singlemindedly pursue the scientific research level embody in " prediction success rate ."
in the course of major disaster warning , too many dispute relate to power and interest be entangle .
the direction of research into -CONST--0 prevention and disaster minimization be just confine to research into the phenomenon of earthquake , but effort to intervene in urban construction , to formulate and supervise build standard , and perfect and improve disaster rescue mechanism and other aspect have be neglected.... .
we have also become blindly abreast of foreign country even in earthquake research : we do n't believe in live being raise as part of nature ; we just believe in the instrument we ourselves manufacture .
we do n't believe the warning send out by nature ; we just believe the warning emit by instrument in laboratory .
we do n't believe in what be see and hear with their own eye by -CONST--0 of ordinary people ; we just believe in the authoritative conclusion of expert and scholar .
NE_country-0 seismology be gallop down the wrong road .
real estate be only -CONST--0 part of the national economy but the -CONST--1 phenomenon exist in every sector of the national economy .
the swift large @-@ scale failure and bankruptcy of collective enterprise and state @-@ own enterprise be proof of this .
thing have reach the step where the national television station have to set up a stage with the country 's military singer , high @-@ class singer , as well as top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line celebrity from all walk of life sing to folk like NE_person-0 for donation .
we should n't be too bother if folk like NE_person-0 say something unpleasant .
a defeat general can n't claim to be brave .
in front of folk like NE_person-0 , the NE_government-organization-0 be all defeat general .
because the miss @-@ in @-@ action army who build NE_country-0 have be beat to a pulp by folk like NE_person-0 ; even if NE_country-1 have no earthquake , there will be flood , as well as NE_disease-0 , snowstorm , big freeze etc.
NE_country-0 be a land of many catastrophe - this have always be true and always will be .
relying on sing for donation , entertain for one 's supper , will not solve the problem .
and time and time again ask the national television station to get out there and carry the national flag , carry on like this in the name of the country be outrageous , it 's the NE_government-organization-0 's problem .
all the people with -CONST--0 mind " as the national anthem be inspire by the foresight of " always be prepare ", design for " advance , advance , advance , enter ! " instead of be design for repeat beg , plead for donation , and fund @-@ raise .
from leader to the common people , everyone need to keep that in mind .
when we go back to the -CONST--0 th century -CONST--1 , we find that the -CONST--2 th century -CONST--3 give birth to the -CONST--4 entrepreneur .
because the -CONST--0 th century -CONST--1 be the very time when limited liability company be establish ; the catholic pope of the time have such a conviction during the -CONST--2 th century .
are you afraid of go to hell when you die ?
yes , you be afraid - ENT_amr-unknown-0 could you not go just because you be afraid ?
donate -CONST--0 property to the NE_organization-0 , show your loyalty to NE_person-0 and you won't go to hell ,
so a lot of rich people donate their money to the NE_organization-0 before they die .
by the -CONST--0 th century -CONST--1 , -CONST--2 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of NE_country-0 's territory belong to the NE_organization-0 ,
but their clergymen could n't manage it , and be unable to pass it on to the next generation . ENT_amr-unknown-0 could they do ?
so they set up the modern limited liability company .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do they set it up ?
they hire professional manager to run these NE_organization-0 enterprise ,
these professional manager be the administrator ,
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the proprietor of these company ?
NE_organization-0 .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 do this confirm ?
the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 step in separate the administration right from ownership ,
in no way because this be a great system , but rather that this be inevitable within the NE_organization-0 enterprise .
when forecast earthquake , ENT_amr-unknown-0 do it happen that only a few case be successful while most case be failure ?
accord to this writer 's many year of research on precursory sign , the existence of precursory sign and earthquake prediction be -CONST--0 issue that be both connect and mutual differentiate .
the appearance of a precursory sign do n't mean it can accurately forecast the -CONST--0 element of an earthquake , because precursory sign be extremely complicate .
there be certain difference in the category , breadth , distribution range , and duration of precursory sign of different type of earthquake in different place .
in " NE_publication-0 , " this writer divide earthquake into -CONST--0 major type accord to the overall characteristic of pre @-@ earthquake sign : strike @-@ type and slip @-@ type earthquake .
the former occur in area where internal fault block or fault line converge but not intersect , while the latter occur in active fault line .
strike @-@ type earthquake have various type of precursory sign , which be widespread , long @-@ last , and quite variable .
slip @-@ type earthquake have fewer type of precursory sign , which have a smaller distribution range , short duration period , and smaller range of change .
in NE_city-0 , which be over -CONST--0 kms away from the epicenter , the earthquake should not have an intensity of over -CONST--1 , or -CONST--2 at the most .
there should not be any safety problem for class a building like those at the airport , hospital and school that be design to withstand a intensity of -CONST--0 .
so most building in NE_city-0 should still be able to use after emergency assessment , and citizen may go home reassure .
if not so , an investigation should be conduct for any jerry @-@ build project .
if large sum of money have be spend to provide protection , yet it fail to work when the earthquake come ,
such that nobody dare to live at home , be able to use hospital , or accesses airport , then have the money be throw for nothing ?
probably some would say the national build criteria for earthquake resistance be enact in recent year , and older building may not comply with the requirement .
however , at the same time the ENT_government-organization-0 enact the earthquake resistance criteria , it require all exist building which do not satisfy the -CONST--0 to be reinforce and remove of danger in a timely fashion .
thus one cannot shirk responsibility on excuse that it be an old build .
in addition , the ENT_government-organization-0 also have criteria for earthquake resistance and prevention for rural building .
the earthquake in NE_province-0 stun everyone .
elementary school building collapse , and children be bury in the rubble .
middle school building collapse , and young student be bury under the crumble wall .
kindergarten building also collapse , and little child 's frail body fall helplessly next to the crumbled wall where they close their innocent eye forever .
we could n't help cry at this sorrowful scene .
children be the flower of our motherland and future of our motherland .
these flower of life die early in a natural disaster .
natural disaster cannot be predict , but the school building should not have collapse .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the building behind the school building still there while the school building where children study collapse from the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 floor to the ENT_ordinal-entity-1 floor leave only crumble wall ?
children , you should n't have depart like this .
every year , all level of NE_government-organization-0 be hold from local ENT_government-organization-0 to the NE_government-organization-1 .
deputy to the NE_government-organization-0 , -CONST--0 make an all @-@ around inspection of school building in all area and inspect whether or not the school building in -CONST--1 constituency be up to local earthquake @-@ resistance standard , and then quickly make a proposal accord to the exist problem and push each level of the ENT_government-organization-0 to complete rectification and improvement within a limited time .
special legislation in the NE_government-organization-0 on construction of school building should be propose .
there need to be special legal procedure for the design , material , construction , completion , and inspection of the school building to ensure that top priority be give to quality and durability .
allow all children to study safely be the sacred and bounden duty of the NE_government-organization-0 .
in -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , -CONST--2 year @-@ old NE_person-0 have already be revive once after suffer a myocardial infarction .
to get effective care for his condition , the NE_organization-0 of the NE_organization-1 of the NE_political-party-0 establish a special treatment team , in charge of his medical treatment and care .
the NE_organization-0 also specifically assign people to the task of NE_person-0 's medical care , take turn with the doctor and nurse to be on constant vigil at his live quarter .
on the day of the NE_earthquake-0 , i.e. -CONST--0 -CONST--1 th , those on duty at -CONST--2 's quarter be NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 , and NE_person-2 's confidential secretary , NE_person-3 .
in the early hour of the morning , with the clock hand point to -CONST--0 @:@ -CONST--1 , the ground of NE_palace-0 suddenly start to shudder .
in NE_person-0 's residence , the glass window in the foyer door rattle uncontrollably , and there be a huge bang from below like a tractor start up , with NE_person-1 's sickbed shake non @-@ stop.......
while NE_person-0 be convalesce , the employee and medical staff around -CONST--0 be all in a state of high tension , maintain extremely silent surroundings and atmosphere .
in normal time , apart from the talk and noise of medical instrument when the doctor revive him , not a whisper could be hear .
after the ninety , state @-@ own engineer enterprise stop recruit construction worker .
but that be n't to say they stop hire people , but those they take in be all graduate with professional diploma from polytechnic school , technical college , and university ; these staff all went into management .
during the early ninety , the formal employee of this enterprise still have complete work team , such as bricklaying team , woodwork team , steel reinforcement team , and machinery maintenance team , but since they could not cope with a large volume of project task , they be already cooperate with some migrant worker unit , in other word the familiar " contract gang ".
a collision occur between tradition and reality .
due to formal work unit no long take on young employee , work unit get increasingly older and break up .
some staff ( extremely few ) enter management .
a few exceptional former team leader gradually become project manager .
others become material officer , safety officer and quality control officer , etc.
those without connection become staff monitor the construction site------similar to the security guard of today .
the worker no long form complete operate team .
and at this time , migrant worker unit gain an opportunity to develop .
the entire on @-@ site operation work be all carry out by contract gang .
work unit disband .
the status of these worker be also change .
the corrupt mentality that treat dinner and gift @-@ give be necessary for get thing done be deeply root in the mind of people from all walk of society .
in each case of corruption , those power @-@ wield bureaucrat , those scholar or technician who have corner the market in their field , those capitalist with vast wealth , they be the rule force of this society , and also the one who profit from the corruption .
the powerless , pennyless work public with no access to information technology resource %pw be the one who lose out from the corruption .
today 's society be corrupt in every direction , and the direct cause be the reinstatement of private ownership and the scrap of the public supervision of the NE_person-0 era .
in privatized society , everybody trample over others try to maximize their own interest .
doctor who do n't receive ' red envelope ' have no motivation to properly cure the patient .
teacher openly ask student to give them gift ,
gang ringleader use cash to have the media make them out as hero ,
capitalist try to annex state @-@ own property team up with scholar and academically demonstrate state @-@ own monopoly to be the reason behind corruption , and then reap in the profit .
frequently the public , under the guidance of the mainstream media , only concern themselves with administrative and judicial corruption ; this in itself be a type of corruption .
do commodity price have a base value worth talk about ?
do commodity have a true value ?
these be already element of uncertainty .
with thing , less be more ; sell as much as you want , as long as somebody will buy .
in fact , in a socialist country one cannot act in that way .
in the area of profit from commodity , there have be no system in place and no legal provision ever since the reform , there be no last word on how many multiple of cost profit be allow to be , or what ENT_percentage-entity-0 .
NE_country-0 's self @-@ sufficient , natural economy be not without any advantage . at least it do n't try to reap large profit off its own people ,
now the exact opposite be the case .
a home appliance - whether you be NE_country-0 or a foreigner , which regional category you fit in , whether you be a big city or a small city , whether you be a worker or a peasant - be always the same price .
not know how much profit be in there , not care who can afford it and who can n't , these do not seem to be the principle of socialism .
and with farmer ' grain and rural product , if the country do n't wipe out agricultural tax and do n't offer any subsidy , keep on produce be a problem .
in order to improve the people 's live standard , the ENT_government-organization-0 set thing so that grain be always the same price whether sell to big city or to rich people .
with this kind of ratio in existence , in struggle area try for a comfortable life be very difficult .
this issue should attract the close attention of economist .
-CONST--0 -CONST--1 , -CONST--2 , NE_person-0 have his -CONST--3 th birth day , his last -CONST--4 .
upon turn -CONST--0 , NE_person-0 feel apparently that he be old and would die soon .
therefore , around his birthday those few year , NE_person-0 have always talk about life and death from ENT_temporal-quantity-0 to time .
one thing he often say be : " -CONST--0 and -CONST--1 be age at which you will be go even if the NE_person-0 do n't call you ."
also since he turn -CONST--0 , people have be pay more and more attention to NE_person-0 's birthday .
within the country , people dare not celebrate his birthday publicly , so they would celebrate quietly at home .
local ENT_government-organization-0 dare not present gift to NE_person-0 , but would convey their blessing to NE_person-1 in various way .
in the year before NE_person-0 pass away , his hometown NE_province-0 would specially send thing like long life noodle on -CONST--0 -CONST--1 every year .
for this , NE_person-0 have accept with pleasure , which be quite unusual .
despite NE_company-0 's status as the globe 's most financially endow high @-@ tech leader , bargain with NE_company-1 be something that be sure to leave you greatly disillusion .
NE_company-0 's dictionary have never contain the word " generous ".
so when the NE_person-0 yangs hope that by bargain they can bump up NE_company-0 's purchase price , they be be very unrealistic .
NE_company-0 raise its price ever so slightly already represent a big concession , prove that it really do want to get its hand on NE_company-1 ! .
ultimately choose to give it up be obviously a very painful decision for NE_company-0 .
right from the start , this be a super acquisition that lack bite ; despite the number be huge , even if the acquisition be successful , truly revolutionize the framework of the internet be simply not possible .
however , when the acquisition do fall through , it be also quite disappointing .
to us global observer watch the bustle scene , give up the acquisition be like a play stop abruptly halfway through , without ever get the chance to watch the rest of the fun , and indeed there be no shortage of theatrical transformation .
we have no choice but to return back to our mundane life , and wait for this increasingly passion @-@ destroy industry to come up with the next affair of note .
since last -CONST--0 , when his daughter be diagnose with symptom such as bloody feces and kidney stone , NE_person-0 have be in succession to NE_city-0 in NE_province-0 , NE_province-1 , NE_city-1 , NE_city-2 , NE_city-3 , and more to take his daughter to hospital for treatment , but the child 's illness have continue to improve and decline .
this -CONST--0 , NE_person-0 , work in NE_city-0 , take his daughter to the NE_city-1 NE_hospital-0 for examination and treatment .
the result of the examination be that the upper rectum be severely infect and the right kidney expand . the kidney stone find in previous hospital treatment be not find this time .
NE_person-0 say that his daughter , a little over -CONST--0 year old this year , have eat NE_milk-0 powder for over -CONST--1 year . last -CONST--2 after the bloody feces appear , family member take his daughter to the NE_city-0 hospital for examination . the doctor inform them that " there be no better treatment method , just have her drink more water ."
worry about his daughter 's illness , NE_person-0 ask the county hospital to issue a certificate to transfer her to another hospital , to let his daughter go to a better hospital for treatment .
the hospital NE_organization-0 tell NE_person-0 that issue of the certificate to transfer to another hospital would require the approval of the NE_government-organization-0 , and more than -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 would be need .
" i go repeatedly to find the relevant health department , but they pass my case back and forth . i be helpless and could only take my daughter to the place where i work -- NE_city-0 , to carry out treatment ."
have to suffer this pain .
the doctor in charge tell us that the kid would be out of danger if he could just urinate .
get him to urinate could n't be more difficult !
this urine be more valuable than gold .
he do n't pee at all during the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 -CONST--0 or -CONST--1 day in hospital .
we be all desperate at that time .
the hospital already arrange for him to undergo dialysis surgery .
and my satisfy son finally urinate .
out of danger at last , but -CONST--0 trouble pass and another -CONST--1 took its place , there come an acute diarrhea and fever , he be stooling several -CONST--2 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 every day , you can imagine the suffer .
he have just dance a circle around the NE_person-0 , and encounted this problem on top of that . i be really worry he would n't pull through .
i do n't know what be happen with the injection treatment at the hospital - the more they inject him the worse the diarrhea , nothing would stop it .
after a few more day of treatment , the kid 's diarrhea be a little better and the doctor get him to do an ultrasound .
the kidney stone have be wash out by the medicine . there be no more stone on his kidney .
the hospitalization be very expensive and our family could n't afford it , so we have no choice but to leave the hospital and go home .
on the night of NE_festival-0 he pass out a stone by himself , it be a sedimentary one .
the whole family be really excite , we all think he be better , that he be cure .
over -CONST--0 NE_ethnic-group-0 pupil in -CONST--1 th primary school in NE_city-0 be inject , *and there be actually NE_ethnic-group-1 student from the same school involved*, it be shock !
on the day of -CONST--0 -CONST--1 st alone , at the entrance of " NE_facility-0 " on NE_city-0 's NE_road-0 , -CONST--2 people be inject and sent to hospital .
on the same day , in NE_city-district-0 , no.106 bus have just pull up at the NE_stop-0 when several people be inject , soon , the NE_ethnic-group-0 assailant jump from the bus and flee , but they be soon detain after bystander give chase .
the -CONST--0 and many other bus also experience a number of poison syringe case .
on -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , the no. -CONST--2 bus explode near NE_road-0 , while the no. -CONST--3 bus be bomb at the same time .
nevertheless , all news be block .
but witness shortly after spread the news to the outside world by telephone - NE_city-0 security be extremely deteriorate !
even more ironic be in late -CONST--0 , when *president NE_person-0 jintao* have just visit NE_country-region-0 on an inspection tour . upon his return to NE_city-0 , the situation in NE_city-1 be far from settle , instead the *uyghur terrorists* become even more rampant , and the number of attack and bombings be increase rather than decrease !
the incompetence of the NE_country-region-0 ENT_government-organization-0 would make the NE_government-organization-0 extremely troublesome !
listen to NE_music-0 by NE_band-0 , see the photograph album in which photo show collage of compatriot receive award , i do n't know when people should cry , and my heart be lose .
after so many year can they still sing NE_music-0 ?
dear friend , let me fill in some of the word for the melody right now in my heart .
do n't worry , the cold @-@ blood be n't me , it 's a part of my heart .
if an NE_game-0 be hold take the damage done to mankind by industrial pollution as theme , i think our dear motherland should be able to win a gold medal and a champion of win the grand total in gold medal . i just do n't know how the open ceremony would be run , how volunteer should be recruit , or which song should be sing lustily .
the title of the sick man of NE_world-region-0 once go far away follow the revolutionary course brim with victory , but after see this group of photo , i feel that they have whistle back with this brand new attitude of faster , higher , stronger .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be different be that i dare not expect for ; in ENT_amr-unknown-1 way can we have again " the destruction of opium at NE_city-0 " with " uphold the country 's interest with one 's life ".
because we and our motherland cannot depart from this shock pollution . what we can do be just to improve , adjust and vaguely hope .
the people who have be sacrifice have , without choice , use their life to pave the road to success for another group of people .
at that time , -CONST--0 of city youth head to the countryside , but by no mean be all of them be true believer .
some be under pressure to show their " revolutionary zeal ", others go because there be no job in the city .
the poverty and backwardness of the countryside be appal , and most of the educate youth become disillusion .
in the middle of the -CONST--0 's the intensity of the NE_event-0 wane , and one after one the youth return to the city or go to study in university , but back then there be n't an exam to get into university , it depended on your political background and behavior .
NE_person-0 be not one of these . he work for -CONST--0 year in a rural part of NE_province-0 , become a village head , and be very popular with the local .
he be a dab hand at work the field , and could match the local when it come to drink spirit .
he marry an old school friend of his from NE_city-0 , and she stay behind for him , the two live their own little life together in the country .
although the villager have no interest in the various kind of " revolutionary practice " that NE_person-0 try to make them adopt , he be honest and kind , and -CONST--0 generous personality won -CONST--1 friendship and affection .
after NE_person-0 have return to NE_city-0 for not even a few moth , the student movement in NE_location-0 begin .
NE_person-0 go to the square to listen to speech and sing , and watch a new generation of student be rebellious , and be shake and move .
-CONST--0 year before , the god of the " NE_organization-0 " be NE_person-0 , but the ideal of young people now be wear jeans and a t @-@ shirt , and a new statue have be erect : NE_statue-0 .
at that ENT_temporal-quantity-0 -CONST--0 live in NE_city-0 , and every day go to the square . when we run into each other , NE_person-0 do n't say much . however it look like he have a -CONST--1 thought stir in his heart .
one afternoon , i go to see an active figure in the square , and arrange to go together with him .
friend greet me with smile , and ask me to go into their tent , as a meet of student leader be go on inside .
NE_person-0 and have just start to come inside , when my friend frown and stop him : " no , you can n't come inside ! "
i explain , say this be my brother . my friend listen with surprise .
NE_city-0 @-@ born and NE_city-1 @-@ raise NE_person-0 look today completely like a villager from the countryside .
NE_person-0 think that this be relate to blockage in the usual report channel .
he point out , all of his report be make under the circumstance that the normal report do n't work , and he have no choice but make report online .
a typical example be that the fall of NE_person-0 , the most debaucherous secretary labeled as -CONST--0 @-@ husband @-@ with @-@ -CONST--1 @-@ wife in the country .
NE_person-0 think that NE_person-1 's absurdity and corruption be actually an open secret , but nobody investigate and penalize ; and even though NE_person-2 report on this use his real name to the concern department for -CONST--0 year , no -CONST--1 bother to inquire about it .
NE_person-0 also think that report online be equivalent to publicize the corruptive deed of the person be report against . once under the public eye , the possibility of any blatant cover @-@ up become greatly reduce , thus , make it easier to investigate and penalize .
many people will ask , NE_thing-0 be make by an individual , so ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the relationship with 360?
there be likely -CONST--0 original reason why NE_thing-0 use a person 's name to issue NE_thing-1 :
general NE_person-0 have do too much bad stuff on pc 's , and do n't want to offend too many people on cell phone , so he find an individual author to act as a scapegoat ( if a cell phone sp company know that it be NE_thing-0 that block their way . each one of them be tough.);
use an individual author to issue it , it be easy to defraud the grassroots netizens of their sense of identification and sympathy .
if you see i be an individual netizen , who have be charge money , so make a piece of software in order to help everyone solve this problem , then how move it seem from the outside .
use an individual author to issue , there have be a strong power of captivation . many company in the sp and wireless realm would definitely think that a product from an individual author would not have much influence , so would not pay too much attention to it .
nevertheless , NE_thing-0 already do this under cover of promote NE_thing-1 in large scale . once after NE_thing-2 become dominant on the situation , then it be to be transform into NE_thing-3 .
have see no hope from NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 then could only post the relevant problem online .
not only that , NE_person-0 's generous and courageous endeavors have lead to revenge from the report on numerous occasion : when report the corruption of NE_person-1 , he be severely beat up by hire goon ; when report the black force , he be retaliate by the black force , and hospitalize for the injury .
but these have not be able to halt the momentum of NE_person-0 's report .
however , in the program , NE_person-0 call out to the party and the ENT_government-organization-0 to set out policy and provision to protect the personal safety and legal right of whistle blower .
this NE_broadcast-program-0 banquet>> on NE_publication-0 's city channel , cause a great uproar in the community .
but in contrast with this , NE_person-0 , well repute as NE_province-0 's " number one person in online anti @-@ corruption ", be now suffer unfair treatment .
because of pressure from the report official such as NE_person-0 , NE_university-0 have suspend NE_person-1 's teach duty .
how NE_university-0 respond to NE_province-0 mainstream media 's positive and active appraisal of NE_person-0 ; how well they treat NE_person-1 ; and how they protect NE_person-2 's legal right , be unavoidable question place in front of the mine university 's decision maker .
the NE_country-0 defense budget for -CONST--0 be rmb 670.274 billion , increase by rmb 67.604 billion and -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-0 compare to the previous year 's estimate budgetary expenditure .
the chinese military expenditure be increase too fast for NE_country-0 , and the increase be currently over rmb -CONST--0 , but ENT_amr-unknown-0 on earth can NE_country-1 do with this additional amount of more than rmb -CONST--1 dollar ?
based on the current exchange rate between the renminbi and NE_country-0 dollar , it amount to more than NE_country-1 $ -CONST--0 , which can purchase more than a -CONST--1 of the latest -CONST--2 generation NE_world-region-0 fighter plane .
if it be use to manufacture NE_country-0 NE_aircraft-type-0 , over -CONST--0 plane can be produce , or perhaps even more . in -CONST--1 go , NE_country-1 can improve its prowess in the air by a margin even greater than the total sum of a mid @-@ size NE_world-region-0 country .
in fact , what NE_country-0 really fear be not the increase of military expenditure , but rather the rapid rate at which NE_country-1 be upgrade its military technology , which may enable NE_country-2 to overtake NE_country-3 soon .
compare to NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 have many inadequacy , for instance , its high technology development be not as mature as NE_country-2 's , and its basic infrastructure , the standard of education of its citizen , development of its system and so on be also lack . however , NE_country-3 have its own natural advantage , and that be NE_country-4 possess a long history and stability of culture .
some people point out in their comment that this be a serious disadvantage to NE_country-0 when compare to NE_country-1 , as they say that NE_country-2 be carry too heavy a burden which will hinder rapid development ,
in fact , this reason be extremely incorrect , the NE_country-0 culture be profound , so whatever problem the NE_country-1 may face , NE_country-2 can draw on its historic experience ,
for instance , when NE_country-0 deal with international affair , it can learn from how the NE_dynasty-0 handle foreign trade and the problem of co @-@ existence between multiple ethnic group , or it could at least draw a lesson from the negative experience .
currently NE_country-0 be drastically cut down on its military expenditure , however it fear that NE_country-1 will substantially increase its military expenditure . NE_country-2 be desperately attempt to return to the NE_ocean-0 as it wish to continue to contain the growth of NE_country-3 military strength ,
NE_country-0 control the NE_strait-0 , and a large majority of NE_country-1 's ship vessel be under its control . however if NE_country-2 wish to maintain the development of world trade order , its expense will naturally be enormous .
if it be not for the financial crisis , a number of NE_world-region-0 country have state that they would not have consider budgetary issue for NE_country-0 military deployment .
as a matter of fact , neighboring country need not be too sensitive to the sharp increase in NE_country-0 military spend . they fear that NE_country-1 will pose a direct threat to them , but chinese history have show that NE_country-2 have never have the habit of wield its military might to challenge NE_world-region-0 country , but as for how they habitually view NE_country-3 will depend on the profound influence of the chinese culture .
NE_country-0 do not like to show off , prefer to restrain itself , and the same be true in the field of military matter .
up to now , NE_country-0 reveal that it have -CONST--0 model of the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 generation stealth fighter plane under research and development , and the NE_aircraft-type-0 be expect to enter mass production and service next year , which be a direct blow to NE_country-1 ,
however , what be even more terrify for NE_country-0 be that this NE_country-1 fighter plane model have already display surprisingly advance performance during combat , and it be fear that its level of technological advancement cannot be match by the f22. after all , this model of fighter plane have never participate in actual inspection up to this point .
perhaps this be understandable for NE_country-0 , but it be inevitable that the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 generation chinese fighter plane would create a stir .
the original order have be disrupt . after all , the NE_country-0 fighter be no less powerful than the NE_country-1 one .
accord to NE_country-0 media report , NE_country-1 's military expenditure be expect to reach NE_country-2 $ -CONST--0 in -CONST--1 year ' ENT_temporal-quantity-0 ,
of course there be a strong possibility that this number have be greatly exaggerate , and it be also embellish by the NE_theory-0 . however , such move by NE_country-0 no longer have much effect on NE_country-1 , even if the chinese defense expenditure reach NE_country-2 $ -CONST--0 , NE_country-3 cannot do anything to NE_country-4 ,
recently , NE_country-0 adopt an aggressive stance , cast negative vote on the NE_country-1 issue -CONST--0 time , and in relation to NE_country-2 's name of the NE_island-0 , NE_city-0 appear to be send a message that ' we have accumulate sufficient power , and we be not afraid of your distortion of the truth .'
the NE_country-0 military expenditure be soar . by contrast , NE_country-1 be continuously cut down on its military expenditure , repeatedly assert that its prowess will be replace by small but elite troop that will not affect its capability . as it be nothing more than self @-@ consolation , therefore , it cause widespread concern throughout NE_country-2 .
certainly , this be clearly a refurbished version of the ' military threat theory ' from NE_country-0 , and it be now change to a ' threat by military expenditure theory ', however , NE_country-1 be use to finger @-@ wag and criticism from NE_country-2 , and as NE_country-3 grow increasingly confident , this writer believe that NE_country-4 will terminate its friendly economic relation with NE_country-5 soon or later ,
NE_country-0 's soar military expenditure imply that NE_country-1 be reluctant to be limit to a position as the world 's no. -CONST--0 , and nor be it content to be world no. -CONST--1 in name only . instead , it intend to recover its historical -CONST--2 @-@ year glory as the leader of the world .
the content be not quite the same as the title ...
let me whisper this : do business in NE_country-0 depends on connection , and red packet be also accepted~same as in NE_country-1 ... :)
face with rascal and hooligan like the NE_country-0 , the NE_country-1 have no choice but to arm themselves .
indeed . i wonder what our military expenditure be like in proportion to NE_country-0 's , and besides how much of our military expenditure be genuinely spend on sophisticated national defenses , if ENT_monetary-quantity-0 be really spend on advanced defenses , there will never be such a thing as too much ! compare to NE_country-1 we be still lag far behind !
now that vice president NE_person-0 have visit NE_country-0 , the direction for the sino @-@ american relationship have become the focus of world attention .
but no matter how sweetly imperialist NE_country-0 talk , i have no hope for imperialist NE_country-1 .
imperialist NE_country-0 have always be a country fail to live up to its word , and as long as something be in its interest , it will spare no effort and use any mean to get it .
the relationship between NE_country-0 and imperialist NE_country-1 be like that between the sheep and the -CONST--0 , and do n't expect the wolf to change its ambition ,
the wolf and the sheep can never be friend , even if so , it 's only an illusion on our part , it 's only a wolf in sheep 's clothe .
ultimately , it will reveal its wolf nature , and i hope the sheep will not be fool by it .
the whole world expect NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 to coexist peacefully , jointly preside over and deal with international affair , and build a peaceful new international order .
the peaceful coexistence of NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 be also the common wish of the people in the two country .
nevertheless , the peace we aspire to will be only our good wish .
NE_country-0 be the fallen petal that have the intention , but imperialist NE_country-1 be the heartless flow water .
maintain friendly relation with imperialist NE_country-0 be only the wishful think of some NE_country-1 !
though there be a great distance between NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 and there be no territorial dispute , unlike our relationship with the NE_country-2 , there be a direct conflict of interest .
however , due to ideological difference between NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 and the lack of the necessary trust and communication in handle international affair , it be particularly imperialist NE_country-2 effort to contain the development of NE_country-3 and its threat to its hegemonic position , that make trouble wherever possible to constrain the takeoff of the chinese dragon .
actually , imperialist NE_country-0 have the initiative in term of whether the -CONST--0 major country , NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 can get along ,
NE_country-0 have do a lot , and sacrifice a lot , for the sino @-@ NE_country-1 relationship ,
out of its wishful think , NE_country-0 use its warm face to caress the cold ass of imperialist NE_country-1 , but it be still unable to win NE_country-2 's sincerity , cause the sino @-@ american relationship to waver and even fall backwards .
in future time , as NE_country-0 challenge -CONST--0 world hegemony and imperialist NE_country-1 attempt to retain it , more clash will happen , conflict will be inevitable , and the struggle will become ever more ferocious .
in recent year , as NE_country-0 's reform and open @-@ up campaign have reach greater depth , the people 's live standard have improve substantially , and -CONST--0 defense and military strength have also develop rapidly .
the status of NE_country-0 as a major world power have begin to be more prominent , and in deal with and direct international affair , NE_country-1 have play an ever more important role .
NE_country-0 's rapid growth and rise have gradually threaten and challenge the hegemonic position of imperialist NE_country-1 .
this make imperialist NE_country-0 restless , and it have devise every possible mean to contain and check NE_country-1 's development .
imperialist NE_country-0 want to upset and restrain NE_country-1 with its military sale to NE_country-2 issue !
the NE_country-0 issue have become an everlasting sorrow in the heart of all descendant of NE_country-1 .
imperialist NE_country-0 want to control the NE_world-region-0 and suppress NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 mainly because it covet the important strategic location and abundant resource of the NE_world-region-1 .
imperialist NE_country-0 want to overthrow the NE_regime-0 to get rid of the NE_country-1 's only military base in the NE_world-region-0 ! it do not want the influence of the NE_country-2 to exist in the NE_world-region-1 over the long term .
imperialist NE_country-0 want to topple NE_country-1 mainly to take on -CONST--0 , to control -CONST--1 's resource and contain NE_country-2 's development .
in addition , it also want to suppress the NE_country-0 and squeeze the live space of NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 .
in today 's world , the only country that can constitute a threat to the hegemonic position of imperialist NE_country-0 be NE_country-1 and , to a lesser degree , the NE_country-2 .
imperialist NE_country-0 have have far @-@ reach strategic foresight , and each step it take serve to consolidate its hegemony .
imperialist NE_country-0 be suppress NE_country-1 in an all @-@ round way , and we can see imperialist NE_country-2 's meddle presence in the economy , politics and military affair .
imperialist NE_country-0 have be support little NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 , the NE_country-3 servant and the NE_country-4 monkey , disturbing the stable environment around NE_country-5 to disrupt the peaceful development and rise of NE_country-6 .
imperialist NE_country-0 be now pompously return to the NE_world-region-0 and reshuffle its military deployment , directly targeting NE_country-1 .
NE_country-0 be the deepest pain for all chinese , because imperialist NE_country-1 have long take NE_country-2 as a pawn and use it as a bargain chip in the struggle with NE_country-3 .
it 's a pity that many NE_country-0 be still hope to make friend with imperialist NE_country-1 and maintain a friendship with imperialist NE_country-2 from generation to generation .
furthermore , the many strategic adjustment and idea of imperialist NE_country-0 be all aim at the NE_country-1 .
many advance weapon have be tailor @-@ make for NE_country-0 .
compatriot ! wake up ! imperialist NE_country-0 have already aim its gun to our head , do not keep daydream !
imperialist NE_country-0 take NE_country-1 as its prime rival and enemy , give up your fantasy that you can make friend with the enemy !
the best method be to make good use of our time to step up our own defense and military construction , cast away all the illusion , and get ready for war !
our ancestor wisely say , " harbor no ill intention against others , but never relax one 's vigilance "!
this be the necessary psychology for get along with friend , but at this moment imperialist NE_country-0 be our enemy stare like a tiger watch its prey , make it more necessary for us to remain vigilant at this time !
NE_country-0 have make a lot of sacrifice to improve its relation with imperialist NE_country-1 , and NE_country-2 have all along tried to become friend with imperialist NE_country-3 ,
although NE_country-0 now need a peaceful and stable environment for its development , we can n't make continual investment without any return .
can sino @-@ NE_country-0 relation be improve ? is friendly development possible ? the key question lie with imperialist NE_country-1 , not NE_country-2 .
imperialist NE_country-0 have always hold the initiative in the development of sino @-@ american relation .
in fact , it be not difficult for NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 to become friend , because NE_country-2 and NE_country-3 , despite their ideological difference , have no land or territorial dispute .
though NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 have fight each other on the battlefield , the war be not directly between NE_country-2 and NE_country-3 .
if imperialist NE_country-0 sincerely want to make friend with NE_country-1 , it must display its sincerity and let the chinese people see actual action and result .
for NE_country-0 , the greatest interest concern imperialist NE_country-1 lie in the NE_country-2 issue .
if imperialist NE_country-0 can stop its military sale to NE_country-1 , provide no support to NE_country-2 , and ensure peace across the NE_strait-0 , it will allow NE_country-3 to accomplish its great cause of national reunification .
if it refrain from meddle in NE_country-0 's internal human right issue , and also do not intervene in other affair such as NE_province-0 , i believe that NE_country-1 will also sacrifice its other interest to reciprocate the good faith of imperialist NE_country-2 !
only if imperialist NE_country-0 do this can NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 truly become friend and co @-@ exist peacefully as friend from generation to generation .
will imperialist NE_country-0 give up NE_country-1 ? absolutely not !
be use to be a hegemon , imperialist NE_country-0 like to intervene in the internal affair and human right affair of other country , and NE_country-1 be the best chess piece for contain NE_country-2 , so i believe imperialist NE_country-3 will not easily let go of it !
there be even less possibility that it will tolerate a NE_country-0 challenge to its position as the world hegemon !
in the year to come , instead of become friend , NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 will only become rival and even enemy !
therefore , it 's unnecessary to harbor any fantasy about imperialist NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 should fundamentally change its mentality , there be no need to fear imperialist -CONST--0 , and we should be ready for a military confrontation with imperialist NE_country-2 at any time .
let 's win the respect of imperialist NE_country-0 and the whole world with our strength .
a peaceful rise be only our unilateral notion , because the big power of the world will not accept the appearance of a NE_country-0 .
only baptize by war can NE_country-0 really become a world power .
the NE_country-0 should be ever vigilant and not be deceive by the present peace , active war preparation be the only right choice ,
only when our defense and military have become strong , will we be able to eradicate all aggressor , and only through the baptism of war can NE_country-0 become a truly powerful country .
in my personal opinion , there must be a war between NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 in the future !
what NE_country-0 need to do be to cast away its illusion and get ready for war .
NE_company-0 be no doubt a monopolized operator in NE_country-0 , the biggest mobile phone market in the world . it have also express clearly its ambition to step outside the country and participate in global competition .
even though the performance of NE_country-0 company be not outstanding in the course of globalization , NE_person-0 , president and ceo of NE_company-0 , be determine to change all this .
on the eve of the NE_conference-0 in NE_city-0 on -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , NE_person-0 give an exclusive interview to the editor of the NE_magazine-0 .
he state that the objective of NE_company-0 be to become a world @-@ class company .
NE_person-0 , -CONST--0 , say in fluent NE_language-0 that NE_company-0 , which be list on the NE_facility-0 , have close to -CONST--1 mobile phone user in mainland NE_country-0 , an equivalent of the entire population of the NE_country-1 .
this signify that NE_company-0 occupy almost -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the market share in mainland NE_country-0 .
NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 , NE_person-3 huateng...
in the past -CONST--0 year , behind these NE_country-0 high @-@ tech magnate who emerge one after another be sure to be the shadow of the NE_country-1 own NE_organization-0 ( idg ) .
the ENT_temporal-quantity-0 NE_conference-0 be hold in NE_city-0 , NE_province-0 on -CONST--0 -CONST--1 .
apart from the -CONST--0 partner , who be call the ' -CONST--1 -CONST--2 ' inside NE_company-0 , the participant also include over -CONST--3 ceos of company that NE_company-1 invest in and representative from investment bank and consult agency .
accord to the practice of the past -CONST--0 year , after each NE_conference-0 , there will always be some participant who make the list of magnate of the year .
i insist on not pay him . finally , he crack and flee in panic .
however , i be also at the verge of collapse because the people 's police at -CONST--0 whom i look forward to still have not arrive yet .
these day , overseas study have become popular . to friend and relative , it 's a proud thing to be mention .
children of the rich and ENT_government-organization-0 official , ENT_amr-unknown-0 do n't want to enhance ENT_amr-unknown-1 status through overseas study ?
let alone that get oneself a NE_world-region-0 diploma will make get a good job easier in the future . even old dad and mom make a parade of it everywhere would look exceedingly good !
however , those in middle class family or even lay @-@ off worker see those children of the wealthy and powerful go overseas , come back cloak in glory and all have a good future ( they do n't know that family wealth and good background of those be the only real guarantee ) . how wonderful ! thereupon , they pinch and scrape to send their child overseas ,
it seem that once they be send overseas , nothing but a wonderful future and unlimited glory will return .
nowadays , it be more often the case that those who do n't pass the university entrance exam and be waste their day at home without do anything be send overseas . with a bit of " toughen up ", everything will be okay .
wrong ! with a huge chunk of cash spent , the frighten thing be that the payoff fall far short of expectation .
even more frighten be that it hold the child back .
-CONST--0 've be in NE_country-0 for several year !
what -CONST--0 have experience myself or , even more , what -CONST--1 have see be the countless who have give up their study year by year , those with wrecked health everywhere , those who sell their soul and even those who lost their life .
overseas study be a splendid term , but in return it demand youth , effort and staunch perseverance , as well as sufficient rationality .
life be never a bed of rose in any location , even more in a foreign land where there be a language barrier , different custom and no family or friend .
malformed society
the proposal on " the transfer of reproduction right " be originate from the same track the proposal on " control the number of rural children go to college "! ENT_amr-unknown-0 else be these representative if not do @-@ nothing politician ?
fuck you ! go to hell ! fuck your mother !
complete and obvious bullshit ! more sinister than directly sell and buy infant !
can NE_country-0 still be save ?
the -CONST--0 @-@ child policy be the most insidious policy , thoroughly antihuman and racially discriminatory , an open trample on the right of survival right for NE_ethnic-group-0 people as a whole . those who formulate and implement this policy be all fascist ; they should be bring to trial at the NE_organization-0 , and the people principally responsible for it should be hang .
this guy really be a " representative ", a @-@ ha .
as know to all , NE_city-0 and NE_city-1 have very low birth rate and mainly depend on migrant to maintain their population size and keep their population young ; there be good economic development ;
in recent year , due to labor shortage , -CONST--0 of black people and NE_world-region-0 have come to the NE_world-region-1 , and have cause vary degree of deterioration in social order .
just like NE_city-0 and NE_city-1 , NE_country-0 depends on immigrant and at the same time pursue the -CONST--0 @-@ child policy , make the plan policy look like a very clever policy !
NE_city-0 and NE_city-1 maintain their social development by absorb migrant from other province , ENT_amr-unknown-0 will happen if NE_country-0 prepare herbal medicine by the prescribe method and absorb foreigner ?
do n't wait till the situation have become unmanageable and then drive away the gypsies as NE_person-0 do ; german chancellor NE_person-1 have just recently declare that NE_country-0 have fail to build a diversified society and will limit the development of the immigrant population ; now that the sheep have be steal , no choice but to mend the fold !
before long , the dividend for the population would wear out . as immigrant laborers swarm in ( these people be not subject to family plan ) , the population would soon experience racial replacement , and NE_country-0 , as NE_country-1 do , would soon disintegrate !
the black , NE_ethnic-group-0 , and NE_country-0 , one after another , would demand their right , autonomy , and independence !
one after another , the local area would become independent , as NE_country-0 do !
the minority people in NE_country-region-0 and NE_province-0 can bear more children , cause the proportion of the NE_ethnic-group-0 people compare to the population of the frontier ethnic region to decline quickly ;
the regiment of troop and NE_province-0 women that such national hero as NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 take great pain to transplant into NE_country-region-0 and NE_province-1 be be quickly exterminate by the -CONST--0 @-@ child policy ; the undercurrent of NE_organization-0 and NE_organization-1 be get ever more rampant !
the family plan policy and the -CONST--0 @-@ child policy have put the country in an dangerous as stack egg , and pose a threat to the survival of the nation .
family plan have effectively reduce the NE_country-0 population by -CONST--0 , postponing the NE_event-0 by -CONST--1 year ; accord to the plan of the NE_organization-0 , even if the NE_country-1 population be reduce by -CONST--2 billion , the NE_event-1 will be postpone for just another few year !
but the chinese nation will be on the brink of extinction . such selfless notion which nobody will have until evolve into a nonhuman creature , surprisingly , have become a reality in NE_country-0 !
the issue of population and ethnical structure be major issue for the survival of the country !
family plan be part of the plan to massively exterminate the NE_ethnic-group-0 people , and the begin of divide NE_country-0 !
the family plan policy be extremely stupid and the ultimate in self @-@ castration . it be unprecedented from a historic perspective and will be unmatchable in the future ; and in the global perspective , it be totally unique !
the self @-@ harm policy fully embody the malice of the enemy and the stupidity of the those in power , bring disaster to both the country and the people , be totally void of conscience , contribute nothing to the contemporary time , leave a legacy of trouble for a long time in future , and will definitely become a joke that those throughout all history will ridicule !
the other day , NE_broadcast-program-0 report that the difficulty for enterprise to hire worker have extend to the west and sweep the whole country !
the family plan policy be extremely stupid , bring disaster to both the country and the people , and be totally void of conscience !
improve population quality require transfer reproduction right to the rich ?
through free exchange on the market , nearly everything can be buy and sell .
today , the right to bear a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 child be also become a popular product with the rich .
they have money to buy the right , to bear the child , and to raise the child .
as to these transfer and transaction of the right to bear a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 child , let 's have a look at how the representative argue and legally struggle with ENT_government-organization-0 official at the " NE_event-0 ".
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do they propose such a transfer on the right to bear a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 child ?
to this question , NE_person-0 of this proposal , NE_government-organization-0 representative and chairman of NE_company-0 , say that such a transfer be beneficial to improve the quality of the population .
transfer to ENT_amr-unknown-0 kind of person , exactly ?
this representative identify -CONST--0 group : first , people with strong educational background ; second , the rich class ; third , civil servant .
NE_person-0 assert that " in today 's society , people with strong educational background , the rich class , and civil servant have relatively high social status , relatively good economics mean , and can ensure basic educational condition and a good environment for the newborn population to develop in ".
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be such transfer practical ?
NE_person-0 give his own specific explanation from the angle of market supply and demand .
he say , " for a transfer , people be not classify into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not .
he say that the original motive for this proposal be root in his discovery that some family legally allow to bear a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 child , due to their poverty and other reason , would become even more impoverished if they be to do so ;
while some rich family have a strong desire to bear a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 child but do not have the allowance to do so .
he think that this conflict really exist , and the relevant ENT_government-organization-0 department can take the initiative to establish a transfer platform ."
this transfer proposal by NE_person-0 be indeed very smart .
on the one hand , it help the ENT_government-organization-0 to reduce and narrow the gap of wealth ;
on the other hand , it also solve the structural conflict of the reproduction right market @-@ the poor have allowance but cannot afford the birth and upbringing , while the rich want to bear children but do n't have the allowance .
based on NE_person-0 's proposal , the rich will voluntarily reduce their per capita wealth by bear and raise more children , while the poor will increase their per capita wealth by bear and raise fewer children .
through such transfer and transaction of the right to bear a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 child between the rich and the poor , the ENT_government-organization-0 can unnoticeably narrow the ever @-@ increase gap between the poor and the rich without spend a single cent .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can the wealth gap be narrow through such transfer ?
this NE_person-0 have envision a fast track for the get @-@ rich @-@ first people to guide and assist the get @-@ rich @-@ later people . that be , " the allowance transferee shall give the transferor ' an entire sequence ' of help and support ."
" accord to NE_person-0 's plan , through lottery @-@ type draw , the transfer platform establish a one @-@ on @-@ one guidance and assistance relationship between the transferee and the transferor .
as part of the assistance , the couple apply for the allowance to be transfer in to them will buy the transfer couple all the basic insurance currently require by the ENT_government-organization-0 , include social insurance , medical insurance , and personal accident insurance , and will continue to provide them with a minimum live guarantee for the rest of their life .
meanwhile , the applicant couple will also provide financial support for the education of the transfer couple 's child until he or she graduate from university .
what 's more , if the transfer couple intend to register as permanent urban resident , the applicant couple shall buy them a 35m2 socially subsidize apartment in the city where the applicant dwell , but all of the transfer couple 's land use right in the countryside will belong to the applicant couple ."
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do our family plan official think of this proposal that the state " utilize the transfer of right to bear a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 @-@ child to improve the population quality and make the get @-@ rich @-@ first help the get @-@ rich @-@ later so as to realize common prosperity "?
in response , " yesterday , NE_person-0 , director of NE_government-organization-0 , make his stance clear to the media that the right to reproduce be absolutely not transferrable .
in the event that the right to reproduce be transfer , it would not only be a violation of law , but also bring moral question if -CONST--0 involve a transaction ."
through transfer their right to bear a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 child and the concomitant obligation impose on the transferees , the poor can get rich with the guidance and assistance from the get @-@ rich @-@ first class , if the proposal can pass and become law , the poor undoubtedly have find in the rich class , well @-@ educate class , and the bureaucratic class an obedient son to provide for them up until they die . marvelous indeed .
he claim it be not a transaction , but ENT_amr-unknown-0 can it be otherwise ? in this bundle of obligation for common prosperity , ENT_amr-unknown-1 be the dignity of the poor ?
do not the bundle of obligation propose by this NE_person-0 still imply a contract on the exchange and transaction of land use right ?
certainly , without such exchange of interest , ENT_amr-unknown-0 would the rich take an interest in provide for the children of the poor ?
if the ENT_government-organization-0 really want to adopt this proposal on the premise of the get @-@ rich @-@ first class lead the get @-@ rich @-@ later class to become rich by give them one @-@ on @-@ one guidance and assistance so as to improve -CONST--0 population quality and narrow our wealth gap , it must ensure fairness in such exchange of interest and during the transfer .
transfer together with a wet nurse .
follow it with interest .
for a transfer of the right to marry , people be not classify into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not . since i discover that some men who have a legal right to marry , due to their poverty and other reason , would become even more impoverished if they do marry ;
while some rich men have a strong desire to marry n concubine ( because their mistress often fuss about want to get marry ) but they do not have the allowance , and would be guilty of bigamy .
i think that this conflict really exist , and the relevant ENT_government-organization-0 department can take the initiative to establish a platform to transfer the right to marry .
pillage the flesh till the bone be see ?
interest ... interesting
logic of hooligan .
directly transfer the wife
a pack of luxury cigarette range from as little as a few -CONST--0 of yuan to more than a -CONST--1 yuan , if you smoke a stick , you be puff away -CONST--2 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 's salary for an ordinary worker .
if it be buy with public fund , it may be say that what they be smoke be not cigarette but the " blood and sweat " of the taxpayers .
NE_government-organization-0 NE_person-0 propose that consumption of tobacco product on public expense should be universally ban .
there be of course many reason as to why we lag far behind in meet our tobacco control objective .
but one of the undisputable reason be that a huge smoker 's group exist within our huge contingent of civil servant .
among this legion of smoker , a considerable number smoke " free cigarette " which they do n't have to buy with their own money , as they be receive as gift or buy with public fund .
it be precisely because they be not use -CONST--0 own money that they usually smoke luxury cigarette which be unaffordable for most people .
their track performance for blow smoke ring also have a compound effect in repeatedly set new record for consumption expense by civil servant , and it have become an organic portion of officialdom corruption as a whole .
it be precisely this horrify social backdrop that prompt NE_government-organization-0 NE_person-0 to solemnly set forth her proposal that consumption of tobacco product on public fund be universally ban .
in our country , there be many civil servant who think their family name be " -CONST--0 " and such that every expense incur by them , regardless of whether it be for public or private purpose , should be bear by the public . therefore , consumption on public expense can involve almost everything imaginable .
for instance , besides luxury cigarette , other example include -CONST--0 liquor , fine wining and dine , -CONST--1 car , and overseas tour , and whatever luxury enjoyment and extravagant entertainment they can imagine , they would want to have them all and enjoy them to full , use public fund to settle the bill in full .
if the supreme authority have to draw up separate regulatory document to address every single item for consumption on public expense for nationwide circulation in order to check such extravagance , the mountain of document will really extend towards the sky .
in fact , all that need to be do be to clearly include tobacco product within the anti @-@ corruption regulation ' relevant clause for prohibition of consumption on public fund , and it will suffice .
as for the remain issue , we must ensure that the order and prohibition be fully enforce . if any civil servant dare to violate the -CONST--0 , he will be severely punish accord to the law and regulation .
if this be really carry out in all locality at every level , there would be no cause to worry that the corrupt practice of consumption on public expense , include smoke on public fund , cannot be curb .
after deputy and committee member have move into their quarter in the hotel , ENT_amr-unknown-0 would service staff greet them ?
some greet them with " deputy NE_person-0 " or " committee member so @-@ and @-@ so ; " while some call NE_government-organization-0 deputy " chief , " which make some deputy , especially deputy from the grass @-@ root level , feel somewhat embarrass . some deputy even request service staff to " not call me chief ."
call deputy and committee member who have move into their quarter in the hotel " chief " be , of course , out of the hotel service staff member 's formal respect , but it have actually cause misunderstand of the identity of deputy or -CONST--0 .
as major national event , the convene of the -CONST--0 conference have clearly provide the path ahead for our development .
however , at the -CONST--0 conference , accord to common sense , the identity of " deputy " or " committee member " be generally use , that be , " deputy NE_person-0 " or " committee member xx." but i cannot say much for the mention of " deputy as a chief ."
through the subtlety of greet , we can see common people 's sense of awe towards " deputy " and " committee member ."
actually , when provide service to deputy and committee member , ENT_amr-unknown-0 's wrong with be a bit simple ?
would n't it appear more cordial to directly greet them as " deputy NE_person-0 " or " committee member xx ? "
after greet them as chief , do n't you have a sense of awe and awkwardness ?
as deputy , they should equally treasure their own ENT_ordinal-entity-0 identity . deputy or committee member be neither an administrative official post nor a honorary title . this identity mean enormous responsibility .
at the " time of the -CONST--0 conference , " deputy and committee member should have an even heighten sense of responsibility . no matter what kind of social status you yourself have , remember firmly your own ENT_ordinal-entity-0 identity and most important identity be a deputy , a committee member .
this be just a tidbit at the -CONST--0 conference . the conference that follow will unfold more exciting content in front of us .
they be scumbags
gosh , they even dare to use the word ' awe .' common people could n't wait to ' despise ' them , ENT_amr-unknown-0 could they have a sense of ' awe ? '
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would you say , ENT_amr-unknown-1 thingy there be publicly elect by common people form by the -CONST--0 , -CONST--1 , and ENT_ordinal-entity-0 person such as you , me , and him ?
before the -CONST--0 national conference be convene , various major news websites and periodical across the country in succession invite netizens and reader nationwide to submit " suggestion for the -CONST--1 ."
this writer from " suggestion for the -CONST--0 conference " submit by netizens across the country on various major news websites on the central ENT_government-organization-0 's strengthen of effort to oppose corruption and promote honest ENT_government-organization-1 , better supervision of the ENT_government-organization-2 and official , and severe punishment for people engage in embezzlement and corruption .
when NE_government-organization-0 delegate NE_person-0 check in to attend the " -CONST--0 conference " and spoke of a motion he propose this year , he say the emphasis be on anti @-@ corruption effort .
the anti @-@ corruption drive involve everyone , from the ordinary people below up to and include the delegate to the -CONST--0 conference .
at present , public expenditure on food and entertainment nationwide have already reach -CONST--0 -CONST--1 year .
such a huge figure for public expenditure on food and entertainment crowd out expenditure on thing vital for people 's welfare , include education , hygiene , healthcare , and social security .
figure list in a bill draw up by the NE_political-party-0 's central organization before the -CONST--0 conference in -CONST--1
be really unbelievable : ENT_temporal-quantity-0 public expenditure on food and entertainment actually reach -CONST--0 ! ENT_amr-unknown-0 large be this figure of -CONST--1 ?
if we save this -CONST--0 and invest it in the economically undeveloped and impoverish region in NE_country-0 , how ENT_amr-unknown-0 school could we build ?
how ENT_amr-unknown-0 poor family could we assist ? how ENT_amr-unknown-1 children force to leave school could we assist ?
it 's a pity that this -CONST--0 be squander with no result , waste in the pursuit of debauchery , by corrupt official - ENT_amr-unknown-0 could our people not hate the " parasite " hide among the membership rank of the NE_political-party-0 ?
when corruption among ENT_government-organization-0 official be bring up , the ordinary people all gnash their teeth , but the ordinary people be , after all , the ordinary people , and can only look on helplessly in silent fury .
the ordinary people cannot afford to upset government official , for if the ordinary people dare to upset government official , they would be crack egg against rock . not only could they get more than they bargain for ; if something go wrong , they could end up in prison , or even endanger their life .
every year , there be case across the country where ordinary people , because of report ENT_government-organization-0 official , suffer the disaster of imprisonment if they get up lightly or the disaster of death if they be dealt with harshly .
it be common for ordinary people , with no other mean of redress , to post on the internet out of resentment against savage land requisition or the savage demolition of home and force relocation by local ENT_government-organization-0 official , but ENT_amr-unknown-0 fate do they often bring on themselves ?
local ENT_government-organization-0 official easily pin some label on you , and you can even be chase and arrest by public security body across provincial boundary .
the most terrible thing be not the ENT_government-organization-0 official , but the power that lie in the hand of these official .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can we prevent the " -CONST--0 type of consumption on public fund ? "
if we be to prevent the " -CONST--0 type of consumption on public fund , " we must first " block " the official ' mouth ,
but this be easier say than done . ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
as people work in a lower @-@ level work unit , if leader from higher @-@ level work unit come , do you dare not to entertain them in the most respectful way with nice thing to eat and drink ?
if they be not entertain well with nice thing to eat and drink , after they 've go , will official in the lower @-@ level work unit still have a future ?
to their subordinate , senior leader be all their " masters." you can n't afford to upset any of them , and whoever upset them be in for it . if you rub them up the wrong way when you 're try to butter them up , you won't just jeopardize your official position , you won't even know what the consequence will be .
to stop the " -CONST--0 type of consumption on public fund , " senior official must first " block " their own mouth .
in -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , when the no. -CONST--2 inspection group of NE_province-0 's provincial party committee go to NE_city-0 on an inspection tour of NE_county-0 , a national @-@ level impoverish county , the local ENT_government-organization-0 official be both delight and worry .
what delight them be that they have an opportunity to report -CONST--0 problem to senior leader and have them take seriously by them , and what worry them be that there be -CONST--1 people in the inspection group , come for -CONST--2 day or so , and the entertainment expense , the cost of the gift , and the inspection fee and various other item of expenditure would altogether come to -CONST--3 yuan .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 could this national @-@ level impoverish county pay the bill ?
this example be the best illustration that if we be to prevent the " -CONST--0 type of consumption on public fund , " we must first stop the senior ENT_government-organization-0 official .
if the upper beam be correctly place , the lower beam will not go awry .
if the central state authority be to stop the " -CONST--0 type of consumption on public fund , " they must dare to do what -CONST--1 mean .
it should be say that wining and dine on public fund as point out by scholar be an objective reality .
with the increase prevalence of the alcohol culture at the grass @-@ root institution , alcohol have already be ferment and adulterate by the so @-@ call " bureaucratic culture " beyond recognition .
some people put on high @-@ end wine banquet try to please their superior , some people use alcohol as gift to seek personal gain , some people consider it a type of pleasure to get people to drink by use beer game , and some people get carry away because of their addiction to alcohol or drunkenness , adversely affect their work .
every year the amount of food trashed and money waste as a result of wining and dine on public fund be even more appal .
this writer have live for a long ENT_temporal-quantity-0 at the grass @-@ root level and often heard and witness some grass @-@ root official almost sit at meal gathering or attend banquet every day , and never get tire of it .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the wining and dine expense at the grass @-@ root level in -CONST--0 year ? a specific number be virtually never publish .
actually , the insider be well aware that this be a considerably high expenditure .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 should be blame for the grass @-@ root official ' wining and dine become common practice ?
speak with regard to the grass @-@ root level , it be indeed necessary to conduct rectification and to straighten thing up accord to the relevant regulation , but focusing on the grass @-@ root level alone may not be enough .
throughout the year , various type of inspection group and investigation group , as numerous as the hair on an ox , come and go in an endless stream , also make the grass @-@ root institution overburden . some grass @-@ root lead cadre , with no choice but to run between the various dinner party every day , also feel somewhat helpless .
there be also many people wallow in the array of wine glass and poker chip become " vessel for wine and bag for food ."
this writer met with some township official . face more and more dinner party , many of them be feed up with it , but also feel force and helpless .
the reason they explain be that entertain be just for solve problem .
a township official , use his finger to count , tell this writer that in order to solve financial , road repair , canal construction project and so on , they must entertain the relevant personnel and department head , otherwise it will be of no avail .
when i look back to all these year , the urban construction in NE_city-0 have experience rapid development .
some people say that it borrow the easterly wind of the NE_game-0 . however , i think otherwise .
even though the -CONST--0 NE_game-0 allow NE_city-0 to display its charisma in front of camera of all caliber that frocked in from all side ,
it have almost be -CONST--0 year since the NE_game-0 and the urban development in NE_city-0 still have not stop .
speak of urban development , the most representative one be none other than the NE_city-0 subway .
those who be born and raise in NE_city-0 in the 80 s can almost be call the generation who grow up sit on the subway .
the public transportation then could not be consider as convenient compare to now . bus could hardly be say as provide easy access to all direction .
however , with their extensive coverage , the -CONST--0 subway line provide novelty and convenience to many NE_city-0 resident and visitor who travel from afar .
the subway be a distinguish traffic feature of NE_city-0 . as -CONST--0 of the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 NE_country-0 city to have underground transportation , the emergence of subway have provide everyone more choice .
this underground railway line that run through eastern and western NE_city-0 have become NE_city-1 's symbol of alternative culture .
day by day , NE_city-0 be develop , so be its public transport and highway . eventually , it will usher in the alarm data of -CONST--0 car in -CONST--1 .
meanwhile , the crowd highway and complicate road traffic cause people to have greater expectation in the development of the subway .
i have to applaud the continuous increase in the effort in subway construction of NE_city-0 in all these year when -CONST--0 talk about subway development .
in -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , with the success in the bid to host the NE_game-0 , NE_facility-0 NE_facility-1 also usher in the completion of the entire line and become the newest member of the NE_facility-2 family .
meanwhile , in -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , the closely watch subway NE_facility-0 go into operation . it become the new trunk that link southern and northern NE_city-0 and intersect with NE_facility-1 .
while NE_city-0 resident enjoy the modernization of subway NE_facility-0 , in -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 phase of construction of NE_subway-0 and in -CONST--2 -CONST--3 , subway NE_facility-1 and NE_facility-2 all became operational -CONST--4 after another . at the same time , all suburban district and county be all connect by the subway successively .
in about -CONST--0 year ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , the NE_city-0 subway transform from an underground supplementary mean of transport that only have -CONST--1 line to a -CONST--2 @-@ line underground transportation network that cover almost the entire NE_city-1 from NE_city-district-0 in the north to NE_city-district-1 in the south , NE_city-district-2 in the west , and NE_city-district-3 in the east .
such rapid development be almost unimaginable by anyone and unachievable by any country .
while -CONST--0 be quickly approach , there be even the spectacular scene of -CONST--1 line open at the same time . it be veritably " put all firepower into operation "!
the rapid coverage of underground transportation have bring along prosperity to surround community of the subway . resident no long have to worry about which bus route to take when they go out .
more resident gladly choose to travel by subway . it be both convenient and cozy .
needless to say , the subway have bring about convenience to the travel and work of the resident . more commendable be that the convenient subway have allow more resident to give up their car and choose such green mean of transportation that be environmental friendly .
not only do a reduction in car on the road alleviate traffic pressure on the road ; it also reduce the pressure of air pollution so that more resident can cheer for the blue sky of NE_city-0 from their heart .
these be all contribution of the subway . yet , ENT_amr-unknown-0 do the contribution of the subway come from ? they be naturally from the rapid development of the subway in NE_city-0 within these -CONST--0 year .
the development of the subway be the same as the rapid global development of the NE_city-0 , it will become a permanent city symbol of NE_city-1 and a benefit project that earn the satisfaction of the resident and the respect of the world .
NE_city-0 force NE_person-0 to declare stand on unification , NE_country-0 can no long turn back
it can be say that the election that cover -CONST--0 major city have stir up a storm in NE_country-0 .
in the midst of all this commotion , NE_person-0 make a sudden appearance to come head to head with NE_person-1 in the election .
this make the already worry NE_person-0 even more anxious , but there be nothing he can do .
this be link to the earlier stand mainland NE_country-0 make regard military cooperation with NE_country-1 . in addition , NE_person-0 have express clearly that his take part in the election be to tell NE_person-1 that he have work hard to get the NE_thing-0 from mainland NE_country-2 and NE_person-2 should not let everyone down .
regard the chaos in NE_country-0 and the future ultimate unification of mainland NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 , ENT_amr-unknown-0 else do we still need to face ? ENT_amr-unknown-1 else do we have to do ?
regard the " weathervane " of NE_person-0 's stand , ENT_amr-unknown-0 other preparation should we make ?
NE_person-0 's transfer of allegiance be to force the undecided NE_person-1 to declare his stand on the ultimate unification
NE_person-0 's transfer of allegiance be , in a certain sense , a kind of response to mainland NE_country-0 's intention .
on the issue of mainland NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 , NE_person-0 have get a lot of room for maneuvering ,
from play the NE_country-0 independence card for the sake of the election to play the card of attack mainland NE_country-1 and achieve military balance for the sake of the election . however , on the issue of the ultimate unification of mainland china and NE_country-2 , not only do NE_person-0 fail to make any progress , he even take a big step backward .
in the past , he be stand close to the middle . now , he be start to gradually follow the footstep of the NE_political-party-0 . he keep push the bottom line of mainland NE_country-0 for the mere sake of manipulate the election . furthermore , he completely ignore the compromise make by mainland NE_country-1 and the effort it have put in for peaceful unification .
to save the taiwanese economy , mainland NE_country-0 have make huge policy adjustment such as absorb NE_country-1 's excess industrial capacity , buy NE_country-2 's excess agricultural product , give several taiwanese political figure room for international affair to carry out international affair , etc.
however , after all this wait , in the end it have to face NE_person-0 @-@ jeou'a a double @-@ head snake that be seemingly false and real at the same time .
therefore , face this undecided NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 step up to defend mainland NE_country-0 !
be n't NE_person-0 want to score more point for his selection ? be n't he want to elevate his position through manipulate the people ?
the moment NE_person-0 appear , the situation change ! this be to force NE_person-1 to stop manipulate the election and declare his stand on the ultimate unification of mainland NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 !
NE_person-0 be not mainland NE_country-0 's only choice , but mainland NE_country-1 be go to be NE_person-1 's only choice
so , ENT_amr-unknown-0 card be NE_person-0 leave with to play ?
military purchase - fetus die in the womb ;
economic development - eclipse by the prosperity of mainland NE_country-0 ;
culture - fully integrate with mainland NE_country-0 as well ;
as for military affair - NE_country-0 soldier , whether ex @-@ service or in service , be all under the control of mainland NE_country-1 's military department .
as for the key NE_country-0 figure who hold military power , mainland NE_country-1 have long ago convince them with reason .
fellow countryman should not slaughter one another , and brother should not turn against one another - this make the NE_country-0 military less hostile towards mainland NE_country-1 .
as for the withdrawal of missile propose by NE_person-0 , it be also no longer an issue now .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 be NE_person-0 still wait for ? for a major change to take place in NE_country-0 ?
to mainland NE_country-0 , NE_person-0 be no long mainland NE_country-1 's only choice .
mainland NE_country-0 be actively seek all force in NE_country-1 that can be seek . even the NE_political-party-0 be start to change its course .
however , NE_person-0 , who be hold on and keep his mouth tight , have no other choice except mainland NE_country-0 , in other word , mainland NE_country-1 be NE_person-1 's only choice .
basically , all the big boss of the NE_political-party-0 have visit mainland NE_country-0 and even receive vip treatment , get all the respect they deserve .
so , be NE_person-0 think about his future position or the great cause of the national unification ?
NE_person-0 might offend some people in NE_country-0 who be eager to achieve NE_country-1 independence , but NE_person-1 can gain the respect of the entire NE_country-2 population of -CONST--0 . compare the -CONST--1 , it should be clear which be important and which be not .
when NE_person-0 visit NE_country-0 back then , he turn the sino @-@ NE_country-1 relationship around . so , do n't NE_person-1 want his name to go down in history ?
could it be that be the bill of a chicken be really better than be the anus of an ox ?
hence , NE_person-0 should understand that he be only one of the choice of mainland NE_country-0 . it be up to him whether he want to achieve success and acquire fame .
watch out for NE_person-0 's continue military resistance against unification by the lease @-@ to @-@ own method
though the NE_country-0 have recently increase NE_country-1 military presence in the NE_world-region-0 , NE_country-2 be show a rare undecided stand on the NE_country-3 issue .
the NE_country-0 be no long able to tell where NE_country-1 be head , because all taiwanese senior politician be talk about unification and there be less and less talk about secession .
furthermore , a certain tacit agreement between mainland NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 regard the NE_island-0 have make the NE_country-2 feel somewhat unable to do what NE_country-3 want to do .
however , some people from the NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 be still somewhat intelligent .
they no longer talk about military purchase but start propose a lease @-@ to @-@ own method for NE_country-0 to get weapon .
the weapon NE_country-0 have now be old .
the lease @-@ to @-@ own method might bring some advantage in conduct cut @-@ edge military confrontation with mainland NE_country-0 , but fundamentally speak , NE_country-1 no long have the strength to fight against mainland NE_country-2 .
if it continue to take its old path of resist unification through military force , then it will meet a very tragic end !
NE_island-0 will be a touchstone - NE_country-0 can no long turn back
of course , there be still many opportunity for mainland NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 . for example , the NE_island-0 be the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 touchstone of cooperation between mainland NE_country-2 and NE_country-3 .
when it come to the NE_island-0 , mainland NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 can jointly deploy naval vessel , jointly defend the NE_island-1 , and join hand in fight NE_country-2 .
recently , within NE_country-0 , active action have be take concern the ownership of NE_country-1 as well .
for example , there have be active change as to how the NE_country-0 issue be treat , how the historical issue of the resistance war be treat , and how the issue of NE_country-1 as part of mainland NE_country-2 in the past be treat .
it be these change that make the entire NE_country-0 , from top to bottom , reach a consensus that it can survive by stay close to mainland NE_country-1 .
face mainland NE_country-0 's offensive effort towards unification , NE_country-1 can no long turn back .
NE_country-0 will become another traitor if it go into NE_country-1 's embrace . only by go into mainland NE_country-2 's embrace will NE_country-3 have a bright future !
in short , NE_person-0 be merely someone through whom mainland NE_country-0 's stance range from active cooperation to slight warn be demonstrate .
if NE_person-0 do not want to oversleep after go back to bed in the morning , he must truly face what the people of both side of the strait have be hope for for -CONST--0 century !
it be up to him whether he want to be a sinner of the nation or a meritorious contributor to the nation !
when that time come , the people of mainland NE_country-0 will respond enthusiastically to NE_person-0 !
ENT_amr-unknown-0 's go on !
damn , these people ENT_amr-unknown-0 do n't learn to be good should rot at home . ENT_amr-unknown-1 be they come out ?
endanger the society !
really , one should not be a samaritan
if you help the other person get up but she do not appreciate it and even push you , then you should not help her anymore .
yet you help her again ...
do n't tell joke at the seaside . it will trigger tsunami
it be really too tragic
meet violence with violence do not benefit anyone
woe of the society .
those who make trouble after get drunk should be punish without leniency . detestable
the follow be a quote from NE_person-0 from the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 post :
the perpetrator be not go to be hold responsible just because they say they be poor ! ? ENT_amr-unknown-0 dare to be a samaritan in future ! ? ...

our family have very poor live condition . my mother only get a minimum welfare pay of -CONST--0 yuan , and she have diabetes . my father be a retire coke plant worker . his pay be also just a bit over -CONST--1 yuan . i be do odd job at a factory , and i have not even make any medical insurance or pension contribution . my elder sister be also an odd @-@ job worker . she have also not make any pension or medical insurance contribution . furthermore , i be go to be a father soon . i have a very heavy family burden . our family now can only rely on my father 's pay to survive . we absolutely cannot afford such high hospital cost .

poor old man . he 's still stick in the era of learn from NE_person-0 . the society today be a mess .
it 's tough to be a good person !
it 's tough to be a good person !
punish severely ! it look like we have to mind our own business !
it be legal as long as -CONST--0 hour of sunshine can be achieve .
most high @-@ rise building with a space of -CONST--0 meter can certainly achieve that .
-CONST--0 hour of sunshine , from morning till night , can certainly be achieve .
most sunlight issue raise by the elderly men and women be indeed not against the national requirement , so they 're merely unreasonable complaint of the elderly as a result of their perceive discomfort .
even if there be a court judgment confirm that the developer be not against the law , they will still persist with their unreasonable demand .
reply to NE_person-0 on the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 floor :
-CONST--0 hour of sunshine be a technical term . sunlight analysis be need . setback of space be relate to not only the sunshine space but also the floor thickness . a sunshine space coefficient of -CONST--1 @:@ -CONST--2 can meet the requirement for -CONST--3 hour of sunshine on the NE_event-0 in NE_city-0 . all we want be that the developer do the job legally , and make it clear that sunshine analysis have show that the minimum national requirement can be meet !
but what you say be also somewhat reasonable . the minimum standard be not acceptable to most people . they have a good reason to ask for more sunlight . however , this developer be too strong . we just want to secure the minimum legitimate interest accord to the national regulation , but even that be so difficult for us !
NE_country-region-0 and operation , alas .
i remain poise
NE_country-0 : there be too many issue now ! be that because good official be too few ?
developer always want to make more money . we have a build here , which have not be pull down so far even after expose by NE_publication-0 . how powerful the developer be .
the follow be a quotation of all owner of NE_building-0 's word on the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 floor :
all netizens and media be welcome to look into this matter . let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the official in general secretary NE_person-0 's hometown when deal with matter concern a big developer ! ...
uh ... do you have legislative power or enforcement power ?
in NE_city-0 , NE_province-0 , an old man do morning exercise help a drunk man up and be mistake as a thief and badly beat up
-CONST--0 young men who work as chef at NE_company-0 be stroll on the street in the early morning on the -CONST--1 nd after down several bottle of beer .

however , NE_person-0 mistook NE_man-0 for want to steal his thing , so immediately together with NE_person-1 and NE_person-2 , he batter the old man violently till he be seriously injure !

latest development
victim : old NE_person-0 be currently still unconscious and in critical condition .
the family member of old NE_man-0 say tearfully that when the old man be be send to the hospital , his pupil be already dilate . he have be transfer to icu ( intensive care unit ) after receive emergency treatment give by the hospital .
the medical cost alone add up to as much as more than -CONST--0 yuan -CONST--1 day .
perpetrator : -CONST--0 men have be criminally detain by NE_city-0 NE_city-district-0 police .
after the -CONST--0 of them pay -CONST--1 yuan in total for the medical cost ,
the family of NE_person-0 recently again raise -CONST--0 yuan to pay for surgery .
hereby , we hope the perpetrator will be able to show resolution in take on responsibility and face seriously the mistake that have be commit .
victim 's family : as old NE_person-0 be still in a toxic and unconscious state , he be unable to provide information about what happen at the time of the incident .
though the -CONST--0 perpetrator have pay -CONST--1 yuan compensation in total , ENT_monetary-quantity-0 be obviously not enough to pay for the current medical cost that be increase sharply by the day .
furthermore , in view of the criminal detention time limit , can such punishment have a deterrent effect on the perpetrator ?
how about future medical cost ?
the NE_family-0 hope to get legal and media assistance .
associate incident
the moment this incident come out , this writer could not help but recall the " NE_case-0 that happen -CONST--0 year ago !
case like the one where " a vehicle owner who help an old lady lie on the ground get up be accuse of knock her down " all raise a huge uproar across town .
sometimes , i even doubt the frequency at which such incident happen , life be get to really look like fiction !
the society always make you feel painfully scare . every day , there always seem to be countless reason that make people curse .
let 's not say much . let 's pray for the injure and hope the perpetrator get punish .
the perpetrator be not go to be hold responsible just because they say they be poor ! ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 dare to be a samaritan in future ?
the important thing be to save life !
are there any solution ? provide legal assistance !
let the law show its might~
it take -CONST--0 day before public prosecution be initiate . even day lily wither by then ! ~
this be actually not about be a samaritan or not . many drunkard have lose their consciousness and will get in a drunken fit .
when you want to help , you have to see who it be . if you can n't handle , just call 120. sigh ...
severe punishment still should be give to those who commit crime after drink . if not , it will be chaos if everyone pretend to be drunk and bash up others .
nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either
such a cup .
the old man be look for trouble . he should have keep a distance after see those drunkard .
would everyone agree with illegal construction of high @-@ rise building ?
now , in the hometown of our beloved general secretary NE_person-0 , such a strange thing be happen .
here be the thing : NE_company-0 have come to NE_city-district-0 , NE_city-0 , NE_province-0 for urban construction , and be welcome by our people .
we do not oppose the construction of high @-@ rise building . however , the developer be go to construct a high @-@ rise build against the law . that be what we be resolutely oppose to !
NE_company-0 have plan a high @-@ rise build of -CONST--0 m in the NE_lot-0 of the old NE_station-0 , NE_city-district-0 , NE_city-0 .
NE_location-0 use to be the eastern suburb park , for which many of the old NE_city-0 people have great affection .
NE_building-0 be just locate at the back of the NE_lot-0 , and now NE_building-1 be only about -CONST--0 meter from the external wall of the original building at the farthest end of the NE_lot-1 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do the developer meet the national requirement for build setback based on a minimum sunshine space of -CONST--0 @:@ -CONST--1 in NE_city-0 ?
aside from the other sunshine shelter , ENT_amr-unknown-0 can the developer ensure a minimum -CONST--0 hour of sunshine on NE_event-0 ?
it be certainly not feasible if they want to cheat about the -CONST--0 hour technically ,
the plain fact be just in front of us . moreover , be those few entity the only one capable of do sunshine analysis in NE_country-0 ?
we certainly will verify it . a lie will never become the truth !
if the developer can not even give us owner a minimum of -CONST--0 hour on NE_event-0 in accordance with the national requirement , ENT_amr-unknown-0 have ensure its best interest , ENT_amr-unknown-1 can it give a reasonable and fair explanation to the society , the vast community of netizens and the mass ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the conscience and moral of the developer ?
we understand that the developer want to get more benefit , but those be suppose to be legitimate benefit !
on the one hand , such act , if illegally infringe upon other people 's interest , will be detrimental to the reputation and long @-@ term future development of the entire NE_group-0 . on the other hand , be people whose interest be infringe all fool ?
will they just let the infringement occur ?
the minimum -CONST--0 hour be already difficult to accept . if it be basically an illegal act that make the fundamental -CONST--1 hour even less , think about it - ENT_amr-unknown-0 will thing evolve ?
finally , the contradiction be bind to intensify , make the situation out of hand .
we hope that the developer can seriously think about this issue , avoid loss and seek its own legal interest through rational development and reasonable development accord to law !
if the developer be determine to infringe on our right and interest , we will surely unite as one to defend our legitimate right and interest !
the most strange thing be that some people of high rank even agree with the illegal construction of high @-@ rise building . we hereby earnestly request the people of high rank who agree with the illegal construction of high @-@ rise building to raise their hand and give us a way out !
all netizens and media be welcome to look into this matter . let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the official in general secretary NE_person-0 's hometown when deal with matter concern a big developer !
all netizens be welcome to look into this matter !
hello , everyone !
previously , due to issue about the high @-@ rise building on NE_company-0 's pre @-@ sale rendering and eia by the NE_government-organization-0 , the young and old of NE_building-0 be neither sleep nor eat well . some be depress , and some be irritate . in short , we feel very angry .
now NE_government-organization-0 have give us a clear answer that those be simply rendering . upon verification , the NE_government-organization-1 have request the developer to make modification . the NE_government-organization-2 will definitely exercise administration accord to law , and never approve anything unless it be legal , reasonable and fair ! a forum and a hear will also be hold prior to approval ! a large stone in our heart have finally drop onto the ground .
we be move that in the face of such a huge benefit , -CONST--0 leader of NE_government-organization-0 and NE_government-organization-1 have stood unswayed , show a very noble sentiment and reflect the characteristic of the NE_political-party-0 in serve the people , which be truly admirable !
all owner of NE_building-0 hereby express deep respect and gratitude to NE_government-organization-0 and NE_government-organization-1 for uphold justice ! people live in NE_city-0 be happy , thank to the official care for them like their parent !
we thank the government for ENT_government-organization-0 concern over people ! we strongly support for the ENT_government-organization-1 accord to law !
all owner , NE_building-0 no.14
-CONST--0 -CONST--1 , -CONST--2
i hope that the developer do not come to compete against us for sunlight . ENT_amr-unknown-0 do we live without sunlight ?
all netizens and media be welcome to look into this matter . let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the official in general secretary NE_person-0 's hometown when deal with matter concern a big developer ! for us ordinary people who be like dog shit in this society , it be ridiculous to discuss whether power or law be superior .
i feel really good about that oh oh
ENT_amr-unknown-0 's the point of law over power ?
it be the powerful that make the final execution .
yeah , in the real world , we vulnerable group really feel at a loss as to what to do so often . the power of developer be too great ,
some relevant ENT_government-organization-0 department just blatantly give the green light to developer against the law and help them fool people !
so we have to frequently ask ourselves : be the law enact by this country really useful ?
be it really capable of restrain developer from grab through deceit or by force and illegally obtain benefit ?
but we can not just watch as the developer take away our sunlight , leave children and the elderly shiver at home in cold winter . if so , we can n't live a healthy life , nor can we enjoy the warmth of the sun !
NE_country-0 have be think about invade NE_country-1 for a long time . would it need the assignment from NE_country-2 to decide whether to invade NE_country-3 or not ? not to mention that the NE_country-4 only act against the political system of NE_country-5 ? was it still not enough for NE_country-6 to be fool after 1991?
the weapon market in NE_world-region-0 have be dominate by the hairy country . though it be weaken by the NE_country-0 weapon market , however , the NE_country-1 weapon market still occupy the major portion .
it be not NE_country-0 deliberately make use of country on the NE_sea-0 to besiege NE_country-1 .
look at the chaos in the NE_sea-0 and the NE_sea-1 , even think with your ass , you will also know that it be the NE_country-0 rather than NE_country-1 try to cause trouble .
firstly , NE_country-0 be not a country with sea power . it have no interest in intervene and meddle in the issue of the east and south NE_sea-0 .
secondly , at present , with the expansion and extrusion of NE_military-0 , NE_country-0 can hardly protect its own traditional zone of influence . we can say it be busy enough with -CONST--0 own affair .
and presently , the NE_military-0 and NE_military-1 be all product of the NE_country-0 's -CONST--0 @-@ ocean strategy .
after NE_war-0 , -CONST--0 system have take place . one be the NE_thing-0 in NE_continent-0 and the NE_ocean-0 , and the other be the NE_thing-1 in the NE_world-region-0 and the NE_ocean-1 .
the NE_country-0 stretch over the -CONST--0 ocean , and control the -CONST--1 system at the same time .
after NE_war-0 , it take control of the -CONST--0 system respectively , castrate NE_country-0 in NE_continent-0 , and NE_country-1 stay alone in NE_continent-1 to be hermaphrodite , live on by help the us manufacture electronics and automobile product .
and now , the biggest enemy for the NE_country-0 be such large geopolitical power in the NE_world-region-0 as NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 .
while NE_country-0 and the NE_world-region-0 have no so @-@ call estrangement in ideology and political system , NE_military-0 still continue to expand to the east .
and now the NE_military-0 be set up a blockage line and a ring of encirclement around the coastal region in NE_country-region-0 and NE_country-region-1 .
the coup in NE_world-region-0 have not succeed . otherwise , once the ring of encirclement be complete , the northern land will cause a headache to you just as the NE_sea-0 and the NE_sea-1 .
do you still believe that NE_country-0 can become a friend of the NE_country-1 as long as it change its ideology and system ?
the reason for NE_country-0 to ally with NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 need to heal their wound from after the disintegration of the NE_country-3 and with the savage hegemony of the NE_country-4 .
solve the exist territorial dispute be an important mean of realize mutual trust . of course NE_country-0 have make great concession . there be no other choice .
in fact , unlike NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 have neither the policy of reform of open up nor a good future ( this precious opportunity be seize by NE_country-2 at the historical turn point then , while in NE_country-3 , it be ruin by the -CONST--0 idiot at the critical moment . it also show that the NE_country-4 be relatively inferior to the NE_country-5 people in term of both iq and eq ) .
the NE_country-0 be bare @-@ foot , so they be not afraid of a NE_country-1 .
NE_country-0 have enough reason to make concession to NE_country-1 . NE_country-2 have no fear . NE_country-3 have many opportunity and NE_country-4 have other approach .
although NE_country-0 be not our friend , we should not turn it into an enemy .
NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 should not be equate with each other .
to the chinese people , if NE_country-0 wantonly kill chinese people in NE_country-1 's traditional area of activity like NE_country-2 do , then in the sentiment of ordinary chinese people , they would hate NE_country-3 as much as they hate -CONST--0 . however , they do not .
the only case where they wantonly kill NE_country-0 people happen at the end of the NE_dynasty-0 . it be the NE_event-0 .
-CONST--0 or -CONST--1 -CONST--2 , the number be just a small proportion even compare with the population of the NE_country-region-0 .
it can even be ignore if compare with the NE_country-0 population of nearly -CONST--0 . can it be equate with NE_country-1 's massacre of chinese people in the populate north and southeast of NE_country-2 ?
besides , NE_country-0 be a NE_continent-0 country with its strategic focus in the NE_world-region-0 . the NE_world-region-1 be never its focus .
if the NE_country-0 really want to seriously take NE_country-1 as their arch enemy , they should strive to construct the NE_world-region-0 .
however , nowadays , with its own serious problem , it continue to abandon the NE_world-region-0 and many city have become heap of ruin .
it show that NE_country-0 's strategic focus have be in the NE_world-region-0 , address the expansion of NE_military-0 . only traitor will be advocate hostile relation between NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 here .
the NE_country-0 can pose a greater threat and impact upon NE_country-1 than NE_country-2 , especially in the core area of NE_country-3 .
the reason be simple . NE_country-0 be a NE_continent-0 country . the NE_world-region-0 be not its focus , while the NE_country-1 be a country in the NE_world-region-1 .
do you know the theory of sea control ? nowadays , be there more influence from the NE_country-0 or NE_country-1 in the issue of the NE_strait-0 and the NE_sea-0 and the NE_world-region-0 ? it be the NE_country-2 ! this be clear proof !
do you think that territorial water be n't territory ? in modern time , the strategic and economic value of territorial water be much more than those of land territory . one can only become a strong power and have a say in the international community by control the sea .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be it not NE_country-0 , its neighbor , but instead NE_country-1 , separate by vast ocean , that make NE_country-2 into a colony ?
nowadays , NE_country-0 have serious problem itself . its armament be quite obsolete , and the live condition for its people be extremely adverse . the population have face a sharp reduction .
the national elite all know the home country be hopeless , so they all run abroad .
it have become common practice for women to marry foreigner , and many of them come to NE_country-0 and become prostitute .
even the productivity of the population be seriously lack . it be impossible for it to constitute a threat to NE_country-0 .
and nowadays the NE_country-0 be besiege and contain NE_country-1 openly with a view of disrupt NE_country-2 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 leave the current problem unsolved , but seize on NE_country-0 , ENT_amr-unknown-1 have no ability to pose a threat to NE_country-1 at present ?
when it come to that NE_country-0 occupy NE_country-1 's territory , that be another story like the japanese do . NE_country-2 want to invade the whole NE_country-3 , but can NE_country-4 do that ?
NE_country-0 be a NE_continent-0 country with its strategic focus on the NE_world-region-0 , rather than the NE_world-region-1 . its expansion to the NE_world-region-2 in history be also partly non @-@ ENT_government-organization-0 and partly governmental .
NE_country-0 be separate from NE_country-1 only by a strait , with the spacious NE_ocean-0 behind it . there be no menace from the rear if it invade NE_country-2 with all its strength . can NE_country-3 do that ?
even if NE_country-0 put a little bit more energy into the issue of NE_country-1 and the NE_world-region-0 , can it ignore the affair in NE_continent-0 ?
moreover , we would rather say that NE_country-0 have avail itself of opportunity , than to say that it have invade and occupy NE_country-1 's territory .
at that time , those place be far away from NE_country-0 's traditional live area . NE_country-1 's exploration be a little bit later at that time . there have be few inhabitant around those place in history .
at that time , those place be bitterly cold place cover with waist @-@ deep snow . so we pay no heed to them .
although when it come to now , these place be of great economic and strategic importance . however , at that time we do n't discover that ; therefore , at that time even the ruler of NE_country-0 pay no heed to the place , and sent no immigrant there for quite a long time .
just like today 's ocean . from the perspective of today , they have huge economic value , so territorial water be also important territory .
however , in the past , they be not discover . and territorial water be not regard as territory . they even exercise trade prohibition on the sea area and close the coastline .
yet the NE_country-0 avail themselves of a favorable geological location to occupy those place ahead of us . the NE_country-1 be just avail themselves of opportunity .
at that time , it be a time when big power establish colony everywhere . unlike today , when the behavior of all country be bound by international law .
other big power have to capture colony by war . for example , it be through war that NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 occupy NE_city-0 and NE_country-2 respectively .
however , the NE_country-0 get such a big place without much effort . that be because the ruler of NE_country-1 do n't care for the unexplored place .
they just avail themselves of opportunity . thing such as territory be hard to talk about .
if it be your imminent area of activity , it might be justifiable .
however , if it be a place that you do n't send immigrant to explore for a long period throughout history , and be take by others because of a favorable geographical location and convenient access , then as time go by it would be hard to say , after a certain length of time .
it would be barely passable for you to claim it to be yours . this be totally different from NE_country-0 . can NE_country-1 launch a barbaric war of aggression to occupy NE_country-2 's imminent territory like NE_country-3 do ?
can it provoke * to invade northeast -CONST--0 and launch an all @-@ out war of aggression against NE_country-0 because northeast -CONST--1 have become an imminent territory of NE_country-1 like northern NE_country-2 with the arrival and exploration of large number of immigrant from inside NE_pass-0 ? it be impossible .
the opinion of the NE_person-0 on the upper floor be brilliant ! however , by reverse the order of " subjugation of the nation " and " elimination of the entire race , " would it be in line with the historical fact ?
right now NE_country-0 be clamoring " to build NE_country-1 into the top military power in asia." NE_person-0 personally seal the arm sale deal to sell NE_country-2 advance weapon such as aircraft carrier , nuclear @-@ power submarine , NE_aircraft-type-0 and NE_missile-0 ... even the weapon it sell to NE_country-3 be more advanced than those it sell to NE_country-4 . and it only sell NE_country-5 big airplane and carrier aircraft . its wild ambition be thoroughly expose !
it be a pity that the present dynasty be national scum support by the NE_country-0 ! while the yellow NE_country-1 be prevail , ENT_amr-unknown-0 else can the grass @-@ root folk do ?
it seem that all NE_country-0 hate NE_country-1 , and i be not an exception . however , have everybody think it over that it be NE_country-2 who stir up the war between NE_country-3 and NE_country-4 for fear that NE_country-5 would reclaim territory from it ? it be also NE_country-6 that went between the NE_political-party-0 and the NE_political-party-1 and be able to achieve success one way or the other . and at the end of the war of resistance , it then stir up the civil war , and lure NE_country-7 to get involve in the NE_war-0 . if NE_person-0 be still alive , NE_country-8 would have more trouble !
even if it have prop up an agent in NE_country-0 , it be still concern about NE_country-1 . and in the -CONST--0 st century , it continue to play little trick of provoke anti @-@ NE_country-2 sentiment . it sell weapon to NE_country-3 and check and seize the cargos of NE_country-4 merchant . its crime be so numerous that bamboo strip would be exhaust before they could all be record .
what be regretful be that our ENT_government-organization-0 deal with such kind of thing in different way . if the us or NE_country-0 do so , NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 would absolutely deliver a so @-@ call just and severe statement of condemnation . yet with regard to the incident of the NE_country-1 boatmen who be shoot by NE_country-2 , there be not even a protest present . and it become an incident with no definite result in the year -CONST--0 .
the greatest threat of subjugation of the nation come from NE_country-0 . in history , country be eliminate by this nation be as many as the star in the sky . moreover , in the history of NE_country-1 , almost all geographical threat come from the north .
the greatest threat of " elimination of the entire race " come from NE_country-0 . the seed of national hatred be indelible . once discharge accidentally , it would not be just territorial conflict , but a massacre .
the greatest threat of downfall of d come from the NE_country-0 . the dramatic contrast of ideology cause the NE_country-1 to treat all dictate ds in the world as target to be remove .
however , there be no need to worry that he would have any claim for territory .
the greatest threat to the economy come from the NE_organization-0 frequently take the opportunity of trade or human right conflict between NE_country-0 and the NE_country-1 to grab a large portion of the market , and squeeze the surplus value . now it have become our biggest trade partner .
personally i think the geopolitical environment of NE_country-0 be quite adverse . however , just as what the floor host say , the real threat come from NE_country-1 .
welcome to the floor host~
do you want to get your blog , your online shop , as well as everything about you popular on the internet ? we can help you achieve all of these !
nowadays , the development of the internet make a lot of thing very convenient ... with the increase of internet user , company and enterprise pay much attention to their online
image . however , negative news about a company or enterprise spread much faster than positive news . once spread out , it be unmanageable @/@ difficult to delete
negative news on the internet . online market or online publicity . for detail , -CONST--0 contact at
qq : -CONST--0
ENT_phone-number-entity-0 : -CONST--0
i come to support , support it
do you think nowadays that NE_country-0 still have the capacity to do that ?
if the NE_political-party-0 do not put the practical interest of the people first , but continue to tolerate the corrupt ENT_government-organization-0 , the people would lose their faith in the -CONST--0 , and in the near future it could hardly be avoid that the territory of NE_country-0 would be divide by an alliance of the NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 !
it be foreseeable that they have put their hand into our neighboring country , and they have instigate pressure on our country from all side . has n't the ENT_government-organization-0 in power run by the NE_political-party-0 been claim to be strong ? and now it be time for you to bring your wisdom into play~
the sino @-@ NE_country-0 war and the civil war of NE_country-1 be stir up by NE_country-2 have the ability to force NE_country-3 to send troop to NE_country-4 ? nonsense !
for NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 have the biggest relationship in the world , and the sino @-@ us relationship be a trade @-@ off relationship .
in the most recent visit to the NE_country-0 by NE_person-0 , which be an exercise before he become the top official in NE_country-1 , the primary topic discuss be mutually beneficial economic cooperation of the two side .
the sino @-@ NE_country-0 relationship be very complicate . economically , the -CONST--0 side be partner on unequal footings ,
politically , it be a relationship between socialism and capitalism ; militarily , NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 militaries be in an isolated state .
therefore , currently NE_country-0 be play game with the NE_country-1 , i.e. how to offset the latter -CONST--0 relationship with economic cooperation .
next be a brief analysis of the main strategy of NE_person-0 's visit to the NE_country-0 :
first , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the biggest puzzle between NE_country-0 and the NE_country-1 ?
the biggest puzzle in front of NE_country-0 be how to maintain its relationship with the NE_country-1 as it become increasingly powerful .
to NE_country-0 , it cannot fall out with the NE_country-1 .
if NE_country-0 fall out with the NE_country-1 , then it will seriously consume -CONST--0 's strength and will be very unfavorable for future development of NE_country-2 ,
because NE_country-0 will lose the situation of peaceful development internationally , such that NE_country-1 have to cope with not only the powerful military threat pose by the NE_country-2 , but also complicate relation in the neighboring area . this will seriously consume NE_country-3 energy for development .
therefore , on the premise of not fall out with the NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , on the one hand , still have to maintain relationship with the NE_country-2 , while on the other hand , it have to precaution against the dirty trick that the NE_country-3 play on NE_country-4 .
second , it be not time yet to be tough to the NE_country-0 .
some believe that NE_country-0 should be tough to the NE_country-1 . be the NE_country-2 someone that yield to hawkishness ?
in the -CONST--0 era , it get in a race for hegemony against the NE_country-0 , where both side be so tough that they become enemy , which provide the NE_country-1 the opportunity to break up thoroughly with the NE_country-2 .
as the NE_country-0 do not need the NE_country-1 to exist as a great power , the NE_country-2 could attack the NE_country-3 and tackle the NE_country-4 without any hesitation .
the road NE_country-0 be go along at present be one where the -CONST--0 side be intertwine with each other , such that the NE_country-1 also suffer great loss when attack and impose sanction on NE_country-2 .
what 's more , many businesspeople in the NE_country-0 also come out to oppose the ENT_government-organization-0 's behaviors . NE_country-1 will be able to truly rise as long as it can keep on for -CONST--0 year .
as the ancient say go , a gentleman can afford to wait for as long as -CONST--0 year to avenge . if NE_country-0 fall out with the us too early , it will put itself in a very disadvantaged position .
although we be strong today , it 's not time yet to fight the final battle with the NE_country-0 .
third , the -CONST--0 phase that the sino @-@ NE_country-0 relationship will go through .
it be not advisable to fight a major war in the NE_country-0 's dealing with the NE_country-1 .
the author believe the -CONST--0 side could only undergo -CONST--1 phase . the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 one be a period which see NE_country-0 grow in strength and the NE_country-1 feel seriously threaten .
the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 stage be when NE_country-0 have become strong , the NE_country-1 be no long certain about win a war with NE_country-2 , such that it have no choice than to cooperate in order to obtain more benefit .
to avoid war between NE_country-0 and the NE_country-1 , it appear extremely important to carry out exchange between the -CONST--0 people .
next let 's have a look at survey result of NE_country-0 view towards NE_country-1 :
an opinion poll of a NE_country-0 website show that -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the people believe NE_country-1 and the NE_country-2 be " ally , " -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 think they be " friendly but not ally , " and -CONST--2 ENT_percentage-entity-2 believe they be " enemy ."
survey result also show that -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the NE_country-0 believe sino @-@ NE_country-1 relation be " very important or somewhat important , " while the proportion be -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 in opinion leader .
on the -CONST--0 th , the NE_newspaper-0 say that in an opinion poll it conduct jointly with the NE_company-0 , -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the respondent see NE_country-0 in a negative way .
this result reflect -CONST--0 urgent issue . first , NE_country-0 be not that bad in the mind of NE_country-1 people , and there be still environment and scope to continue expand exchange .
second , if NE_country-0 and the NE_country-1 do not handle their relation properly , lack in communication between its people and the foundation or friendship , then the chinese and NE_country-2 people may turn hostile .
therefore , the NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 people must enhance cooperation and bring the two side closer through economic cooperation , so as to offset the discrepancy bring by military and politics .
however , it be undeniable that serious conflict remain between NE_country-0 and the NE_country-1 in some important area .
for instance : the NE_country-0 issue ; human right and democracy ; NE_country-1 ; NE_country-2 ; proliferation of weapon of mass destruction ; NE_country-3 ; geopolitics and military strategy ; trade and currency ; intellectual property right and internet spy .
these puzzle cannot be overcome with the -CONST--0 character of friendship alone . after all it involve major interest .
so it be no secret to the -CONST--0 side . just like vice president NE_person-0 count on the NE_country-0 to oppose NE_country-1 independence and NE_province-0 , ENT_amr-unknown-0 could NE_country-2 count on a geopolitical enemy ?
national president be all master in politics , who know what 's at stake . however , what should be say should be say . the thing be if the NE_country-0 have say something , it will break -CONST--0 word if it do n't do what it say , which will show to people in the world that the NE_country-1 be immoral and its word do n't count .
anyway , between NE_country-0 and the NE_country-1 in the future , whoever be a better strategist and whoever come up with more sophisticated strategy win .
it require wisdom to be friend with an enemy . you can only fight a -CONST--0 war without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
this view tell us a fact that one will earn respect by develop military force
the cannon be thick
it require wisdom to be friend with an enemy . you can only fight a -CONST--0 war without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
chairman NE_person-0 have say a long time ago : one will be beat if he @/@ she be backward . only development be of override importance !
it be fun ? they be order the dog they fee at home to bark at you , yet you have go to shake hand with -CONST--0 , look for slap
it be fun ? they be order the dog they fee at home to bark at you , yet you have go to shake hand with -CONST--0 , look for slap
brainwash the NE_country-0 people on behalf of the NE_country-1 .
brainwash the NE_country-0 people on behalf of the NE_country-1 .
be it the NE_country-0 system that 's superior or the NE_country-1 system that 's superior after all ?
i think NE_country-0 and the mainland be already distinguish relative superiority or inferiority between -CONST--0 . the thread starter should take a look outside the country more
you look but not see the NE_city-0 's chaos in society , or be it voluntary blindness !
i also feel that there be more modern " traitor of NE_country-0 " than during wwii .
everyone have eye , look at the live situation of NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 - do you still not understand ?
venture exchange ,
if i take care of myself , that 's good enough , when the country need me , i 'll be compel by my sense of righteousness
if these traitor of NE_country-0 exist around -CONST--0 , -CONST--1 year ago , they would already have be execute by fire squad .
to make a conclusion , you must have something to demonstrate it
i do n't have time to go search
i wish NE_person-0 would explain them one by one ...
their property and family be all outside of the country , of course they will , just like the official .
when the country need me , i 'll be compel by my sense of righteousness
i can just take a look , and dare not to speak my mind , the police can grab people , thread starter , i admire you for dare to speak ! bump !
the rule authority actually should pay attention to these kind of capitulators and traitor of NE_country-0 !
comrade NE_person-0 once say that the NE_political-party-0 will not be overthrow - if it fall , it will be bring down from within the party itself .
former NE_country-0 ambassador to NE_country-1 NE_person-0 once say in a speech in the NE_country-2 : we will raise -CONST--0 spokespeople in NE_country-3 , let the chinese themselves topple NE_country-4 -
and the NE_government-organization-0 then use an ENT_temporal-quantity-0 -CONST--0 yuan subsidy to help these domestic so @-@ call elite , vow that they want to let them raise the wind to make wave domestically , citizen definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsider use us .
in the summer of -CONST--0 , a picture that people have long be look forward to start emerge with frequency in various major NE_city-0 media .
with their unique charm , these well - know cartoon image once again cause NE_city-0 to be a focus of worldwide attention .
the world 's ENT_ordinal-entity-0 NE_park-0 will soon open to the public here .
the most important thing about NE_company-0 be that it be a global brand .
well , for several year , although it be still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be say that many people have view NE_city-0 with new respect .
then welcome to the official write ceremony of NE_amusement-park-0 .
the construction of NE_amusement-park-0 begin -CONST--0 year ago , in -CONST--1 .
in -CONST--0 of that year , the NE_city-0 ENT_government-organization-0 turn over to NE_company-0 -CONST--1 hectare of land at the foot of NE_island-0 that be obtain follow the largest land reclamation project in recent year .
one .
since then , this area have become a prohibit zone in NE_city-0 .
as its neighbor on NE_island-0 , NE_airport-0 have to change its flight route to make this area a no - fly zone .
NE_person-0 's new home , settle on NE_country-0 land for the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time , have capture worldwide attention .
there 's only -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 left before the open of NE_amusement-park-0 on -CONST--1 -CONST--2 .
the subway to NE_amusement-park-0 have already be construct .
at subway station , passenger will frequently press the station for NE_amusement-park-0 on ticket machine , try to purchase ticket to enjoy the park when it ENT_ordinal-entity-0 open .
meanwhile , the NE_amusement-park-0 subway station be schedule to open on the same day as the park .
for -CONST--0 year , NE_company-0 have constantly maintain its mystery .
no media have be allow to enter for photo .
we take a taxi along the path of the highway that head toward NE_amusement-park-0 , try to experience this mysterious park from close by .
however , before any of the -CONST--0 symbol be in sight , the car be stop by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards NE_amusement-park-0 .
on our way back , the taxi driver give us an explanation after understand our intention .
er , accord to what the security guard say , for the time before everything be officially open , open , all , no car can enter unless they have special permission .
no one can enter otherwise .
video record be especially forbid .
ah , everything be top secret .
if picture be take without permission , %pw that be to say , it will at all time be pursue by legal action , a big hassle .
although NE_company-0 choose NE_city-0 as the venue for the NE_country-0 NE_amusement-park-0 , what they be actually most excite about be the mainland -CONST--0 tourist market .
since the implementation of the NE_law-0 between NE_city-0 and the mainland , more and more mainland tourist be come to visit NE_city-1 .
from the begin up till now , more than -CONST--0 individual tourist have , have come to NE_city-0 .
well , we now , er , believe more will be come .
at this point , it have be about -CONST--0 year .
also , the current number of -CONST--0 city will be increase .
NE_city-0 be develop from a fish harbor -CONST--0 year ago to become today 's international metropolis .
here , NE_world-region-0 and NE_world-region-1 culture have gather , and the new and the old coexist .
when in NE_city-0 , you can wander among skyscraper , heartily enjoy shop spree in well - know store and mall for goods from various country , and taste delicious snack from all over the world at tea shop or at street stand in NE_city-district-0 .
you can go to burn incense and make a vow at the NE_bay-0 , where all deity gather .
you can enjoy the most charm sun - fill sandy beach in NE_city-0 .
you can ascend NE_mountain-0 to get a panoramic view of NE_harbor-0 's beautiful scenery .
or hop onto a trolley with over -CONST--0 century of history , and feel the city 's blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .
after dark , cruise NE_harbor-0 at night to enjoy the enchant even view .
every corner of NE_city-0 be fill with fun .
meanwhile , as various new item be constantly be add , ENT_amr-unknown-0 other kind of pleasant surprise will the NE_city-0 tourism industry bring us ?
over the past -CONST--0 year , the NE_amusement-park-0 have basically be a must - see destination for tourist come to NE_city-0 .
watch spectacular performance by dolphin and sea lion at the NE_theater-0 , and experience passionate scream and accelerate heart - beat adventure on amusement ride .
or ride the giant NE_wheel-0 to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of NE_island-0 and the NE_sea-0 .
these item , which be the pride of the NE_amusement-park-0 , have make this place the most popular tourist attraction in NE_city-0 for some time .
however , since NE_company-0 enter NE_city-0 , the NE_amusement-park-0 , share the same city as NE_company-1 , have feel the pressure of competition .
to improve the park 's brand , they be plan to invest -CONST--0 in a renovation project start in -CONST--1 .
it seem that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .
that be , the entire park will be divide into -CONST--0 section for renovation .
ah , additional , new , ah , attraction will be available for tourist .
it seem that those attraction like the NE_world-region-0 and the NE_facility-0 will also be renovate after several year .
are they go to be different from what they be now ?
they will be , in -CONST--0 year .
ah , there will be more animal , and more animal species , different from what there be now .
it look like we will also bring in whale .
er , we will implement this plan as soon as it be approve by the ENT_government-organization-0 .
groundbreaking be expect to start next year .
yes .
the ENT_area-quantity-0 of NE_city-0 be only -CONST--0 - plus square kilometers .
the population be dense .
natural resource be relatively scarce .
however , the clever NE_city-0 people will utilize all resource they have create for develop the NE_city-1 tourism industry .
among these be the NE_facility-0 .
enter NE_location-0 ,
here , you can come up close with the star in your mind .
he be my .
she be my NE_person-0 , ah .
-CONST--0 stay with us on NE_broadcast-program-0 .
NE_city-0 have always wear the crown of NE_location-0 .
over the past -CONST--0 year of film history , NE_city-0 cinema have nurture many internationally renowned director , actor , and screenwriters .
they have shorten the distance between NE_city-0 and the world .
NE_city-0 movie have even become a window for the world to see NE_city-1 , which have make the image of metropolitan NE_city-2 more prominent internationally .
for this reason , in -CONST--0 , on the NE_facility-0 originally construct for view only the scenery of NE_island-0 and NE_harbor-0 , the NE_government-organization-0 also construct NE_facility-1 , memorialize NE_city-0 's -CONST--1 - year film history .
here , tourist can learn about NE_city-0 's film history , and can come up close with the star in their mind .
NE_city-0 be a busy metropolis .
even at dusk , the city 's pulse never stop beat .
across from NE_facility-0 , a special performance be stage every weekend .
%pw as our NE_harbor-0 be %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape be already very beautiful , by ENT_amr-unknown-0 mean could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?
so , -CONST--0 idea be to transform NE_harbor-0 into a performance stage .
er , each key build be like a performer .
it be based on this that music and light be arrange to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinate multi @-@ media world - class light show .
let me now introduce to you all the well - know skyscraper participate in this large - scale light and music show .
the NE_facility-0 , NE_facility-1 , at 8 @:@ -CONST--0 every saturday night , NE_facility-2 .
their performance will be on schedule .
center of the NE_facility-0 .
-CONST--0 landmark building locate on NE_island-0 reveal themselves one by one , participate in the show in full splendor , present a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .
whenever there be a major event or holiday , firework be also add to the light show .
some , er , city have consult with us .
uh @-@ huh .
their area of surprise be that those private , er , building , that be , the business community , ah , be willing to invest in our overall project .
yes .
the answer be that this be a reward to the entire society , not an individual build 's reward .
er , of course , after NE_event-0 , we feel that all of NE_city-0 hope to be involve , so that the NE_city-1 tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sector .
NE_park-0 , which be currently under construction , be also one of the designate new project of the NE_city-0 ENT_government-organization-0 for advance the hong kong tourism industry .
this be a park intimately connect with nature , be build by the NE_city-0 ENT_government-organization-0 for its people who live in a city of reinforce concrete .
NE_park-0 cover an ENT_area-quantity-0 of -CONST--0 hectare , include a -CONST--1 square meter visitor 's center and a -CONST--2 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .
in the indoor exhibition hall , tourist can learn about type of wetlands in various part of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .
outdoors , they can also personally experience wetland ecology .
at the highest point of NE_city-0 , er , from the highest point we can see -CONST--0 different ecological environment .
ha , on that side be many tall building , that be , town with lot of people live there ,
but behind me be our NE_park-0 .
ha , entirely different .
quite primitive ,
er , a fresh water swamp ,
er , the NE_facility-0 .
lastly , far away you can see NE_city-0 of NE_city-1 .
then , the bridge be , on the bridge be NE_city-0 and outside be NE_city-1 .
you can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .
children can get to know different animal and plant , and even some crop that be rarely see in our ENT_temporal-quantity-0 life .
over here be paddy field , which be rather unique .
ha , there be aquatic plant inside .
ah , the most special be rice , because %pw many NE_city-0 children nowadays have never see what -CONST--0 look like .
look over there .
they be go to be ripe soon .
the long one over there .
oh .
yes .
with , with ear , ah .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
ah , here .
perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the name of the crop when they see them .
let , let them get some understand .
NE_location-0 adjacent to NE_park-0 be a major wildlife habitat within NE_continent-0 .
each year , over -CONST--0 migratory bird fly over NE_city-0 's skyscraper and choose to roost for winter here .
as a result , -CONST--0 different type of aviary be build in NE_park-0 .
these have become the best spot to observe bird .
among common bird , a rather special one be the black - face spoonbill .
it be an endanger bird species throughout the world .
uh @-@ huh .
ah , there be only about -CONST--0 in the world .
wow .
um , however , each year , about two to -CONST--0 of them come to NE_city-0 to spend the winter .
some of them , er , have stay in NE_park-0 .
uh @-@ huh .
so , our park 's logo be unique , feature this black - face spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention .
uh @-@ huh .
NE_park-0 worker be now in the middle of intensive work .
they will complete the park 's entire construction by the begin of -CONST--0 , to be able to participate in the ENT_date-entity-0 NE_campaign-0 .
ah , we have establish the year -CONST--0 as NE_event-0 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be that ?
because , as everyone know , our NE_amusement-park-0 will open in -CONST--0 of this year .
in addition , we will have NE_car-0 , that be , the cable car , er , to the NE_work-of-art-0 .
they add to what we already have , like the NE_facility-0 , which be also very famous .
moreover , er , we be include our software .
NE_city-0 's software be very well know .
like what 's use in our NE_event-0 .
we hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire -CONST--0 NE_event-0 .
without plan it in advance , they choose to settle here .
a dream that have be anticipate for more than -CONST--0 year will soon come true here .
because your line connect us with two --
in recent year , NE_city-0 's tourist attraction have gradually move from NE_island-0 to NE_city-1 and the NE_local-region-0 .
-CONST--0 out of the -CONST--1 new attraction participate in the -CONST--2 NE_event-0 be locate on NE_island-0 of the NE_local-region-0 .
for this reason , NE_island-0 have become a new NE_city-0 tourism popular spot .
the earliest to settle here be this world 's largest outdoor seat bronze NE_work-of-art-0 .
in NE_country-0 NE_religious-group-0 , there be -CONST--0 direction - east , west , south , north , and center - and -CONST--1 NE_person-0 .
therefore , NE_city-0 's NE_work-of-art-0 at the most southern tip of NE_country-0 , together with NE_work-of-art-1 in the east , NE_work-of-art-2 in the west , NE_work-of-art-3 in the north , and NE_work-of-art-4 in the NE_country-region-0 , exist as the representative buddhas for each of the -CONST--0 direction of NE_country-1 .
as a result , this place have become holy land in the heart of male and female devotee .
however , to common tourist , more of what this place bring -CONST--0 be wonder and awe .
since this giant bronze NE_work-of-art-0 settle on NE_island-0 , the world renowned NE_airport-0 at NE_island-1 and NE_amusement-park-0 have also be construct here in succession .
the important status of NE_island-0 be increasingly apparent .
no , it be totally inaccessible in the past .
in the near future , construction will also begin on a cross @-@ sea bridge connect NE_city-0 , NE_city-1 , and NE_city-2 .
in -CONST--0 --
could n't go in summer --
so , after their return , NE_city-0 , and NE_city-1 , the -CONST--0 special administrative region , be basically still use ship and helicopter to stay connect .
it 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
one have to go up to NE_city-0 , NE_city-1 , then go through NE_local-region-0 , keep go up , to NE_city-2 , and certainly go to NE_city-3 , then pass through NE_city-4 to get to NE_city-5 .
for a NE_city-0 person choose to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .
a full -CONST--0 year ago , NE_company-0 chairman NE_person-0 , a well - know construction tycoon , boldly make a cross @-@ sea bridge proposal .
with this bridge , the ENT_distance-quantity-0 would be very small , only a little over -CONST--0 kilometer .
however , due to various reason , bridge construction be put off .
this be what we have see since -CONST--0 .
anticipate for -CONST--0 year , today this dream be finally come true .
well , originally the construction of the new --
with this new hong kong - zhuhai - macao bridge that basically lead to all three place , NE_city-0 , NE_city-1 , and NE_city-2 , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .
NE_city-0 be this way , and NE_city-1 be this way .
from the perspective of either NE_city-0 , NE_city-1 , or NE_city-2 , our concept be a tourism zone .
er , %pw NE_city-0 for sightsee tour , NE_city-1 for entertainment , and we have NE_amusement-park-0 and other , other attraction in NE_city-2 .
each place have different attraction of its own .
so , with this bridge , when some old friend , friend from mainland NE_country-0 or from foreign country come to our place , it seem they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several day , before , ha , go home .
-CONST--0 the NE_bridge-0 be build , it will no longer be a dream of tourist to enjoy gourmet food in NE_city-0 before have fun at NE_amusement-park-0 just -CONST--1 hour later .
promotion of NE_amusement-park-0 have long since begun .
however , even though it have enter the last countdown period before its final open , this wonderland be still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .
ah , currently it have be decide that NE_amusement-park-0 will open on -CONST--0 -CONST--1 .
there 's also what we call soft open .
ah , they be now rehearse .
ah , different , ah , some group , they be rehearse their service , well , hope that they will become use to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourist come in -CONST--0 .
well , i be very confident , that when our tourist come to NE_amusement-park-0 , they will certainly return home very satisfy .
NE_event-0 will start from NE_city-0 .
this dynamic metropolis never cease its movement .
it continue to explore ; it continue to open new world .
each day , there be always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .
NE_city-0 be a world famous shop paradise .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 determine the position of NE_city-0 as a shop paradise ?
be it because of abundant merchandise or high quality at low price ?
be it a paradise for the rich or the general public ?
after all , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the joyful memory from inside paradise ?
we respectfully invite you to watch NE_broadcast-program-0 in this edition of NE_broadcast-program-1 .
hello , everyone .
this be the NE_broadcast-program-0 on NE_channel-0 .
welcome to our program .
-CONST--0 let 's focus on the main content of today 's program .
NE_person-0 say that he have decide not to continue serve as NE_political-party-0 vice chairman .
candidate for the giant panda to be present to NE_country-0 as gift from the mainland may increase .
NE_country-0 's military use NE_event-0 as an opportunity for press arm procurement .
recently , the -CONST--0 NE_event-0 NE_event-1 be hold in the NE_city-0 .
more than -CONST--0 NE_country-0 businesspeople gather in this land know as " lush southern - type field north of the NE_facility-0 , " begin their tour and inspection journey .
well , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the unique charm in NE_city-0 of the western region that have attract the attention of so many NE_country-0 businesspeople ?
-CONST--0 watch this edition of NE_broadcast-program-0 for a detailed report .
the NE_political-party-0 vice chairman arrive at party headquarters to meet with NE_political-party-1 chairman NE_person-0 on the afternoon of %pw .
after a long talk of over -CONST--0 hour , NE_person-0 express his wish not to renew his term as NE_organization-0 vice chairman .
he say that he will follow NE_person-0 as a lifelong volunteer .
%pw
he can n't seem to help himself from apologize for anything and everything .
NE_company-0 could make a fortune off of this guy .
i do n't follow , ENT_amr-unknown-0 should he apologize to NE_person-0 ?
did NE_person-0 apologize to NE_person-1 ?
he need to conduct a beer summit between NE_person-0 and NE_publication-0 .
mend some fence and get this country move .
he could call it the NE_tour-0 .
hell , sell ticket and hire the NE_country-0 to cater the event .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 drop out after super tuesday ?
i think NE_person-0 win big today and obviously stay in .
NE_person-0 get enough of a boost to do the NE_person-1 hang around .
i think NE_person-0 's sole win in NE_state-0 be enough to hang it up and go back to make -CONST--0 in the private sector .
i think the NE_person-0 be too crazy to hang it up .
i will stick around until the end .
no one
i think NE_person-0 drop out...
ok , my answer be no one and NE_person-0 win the NE_event-0 .
the only one with any reason to will be NE_person-0 , but i do n't think that he will .
NE_person-0 say tornado victim should not get aid
nut .
my heart go out to the people in tornado alley and i have no problem with my tax dollar go to help the survivor rebuild -CONST--0 life .
if you have no problem with your tax dollar go to aid them then you 'd have no problem donate to them of your own free will .
not to mention that he 's absolutely right that they should have insurance to cover them .
NE_person-0 be not quite bright .
he 's right in some way but it do n't translate into be right across the board .
this be n't like someone 's house burn down and they make an insurance claim .
everything be go , the entire infrastructure be go .
even if someone have insurance to cover their loss , that won't extend to the road , power line , sewer , public building .
the problem with this regime be aid be not distribute equally .
NE_political-party-0 get it , minority get it , white NE_political-party-1 jurisdictions do n't .
aid be now patronage , good party member get it .
be n't it interest how libertarian ' desire for " freedom " correspond so neatly with skinflint who do n't want to give anyone , anything .
so while libertarianism attract people who want to be " free " it also attract cheap asshole who do n't want to pay their fair share .
perhaps when libertarian figure out a way to differentiate between the two , i 'll vote for them .
i get what NE_person-0 be say .
thats what a hardcore libertarian would say .
but the rest of us be think about the people that do not have insurance and @/@ or need help right now .
kind of hard to build a house over night , mr NE_person-0 .
kind of hard to import food consider that the store be probably wipe out too .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do one survive until the insurance( hopefully by a respectable company ) claim come through ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do one survive ENT_amr-unknown-1 you have the fund but the people you need to buy the goods from have no address ?
i know , you get into your pickup and drive over to the next town -- if you can find your damn pickup ! !
homeowners generally have insurance , but federal aid be necessary to provide for the clean up , repair of electrical and water system , road , school , bus , etc. etc.
keep in mind insurance company be not in the business of pay claim , they be in the business of make money .
anyone who suffer a loss as have those who lost everything over the weekend will not be make whole , and whatever claim they receive will not come soon or easy .
NE_person-0 and his libertarian idea be at best impractical .
no surprise there .
he have to win there to stay in , so ultimately this help NE_person-0 keep the vote split .
best outcome of the night would have be NE_person-0 lose there .
he 's a nonfactor at this point and only in out of spite .
if he be out of the race , NE_person-0 might have have a chance .
the NE_religious-group-0 be oppose to contraception for moral reason .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the morality in create a life when food and clean water be rare commodity ?
where poverty exist and educational opportunity be non existent ?
where be the morality ENT_amr-unknown-0 disease be spread ?
where be the morality ENT_amr-unknown-0 a women be the victim of domestic violence ?
when a women be force to conceive and then trap as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control ?
i be with you .
if you cant fee , house and take care of a baby you have no business have one .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be it literally -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 impossible for the liberal mind to understand that just because you do n't want government involve in something do n't mean you 're against it ?
i 'm in favor of feed , clothe , and give shelter to the poor . i 'm against all the gov't institution that tax our brain out and who inefficiently attempt to provide some of these thing .
now be i just a genius who do n't know it , or be it really not that hard to understand such a simple concept ?
will they try to prop NE_person-0 up with a strong vp to help make him more palatable - or will they bring in a new face ?
either way , they 've get a big problem .
are n't you one of the asshole who assure us how NE_person-0 be inevitable as the NE_political-party-0 nominee ?
i do n't think NE_person-0 will tank , its go to be a close one till the very end , i be still root for a NE_person-1 @/@ NE_person-2 ticket .
wow , another NE_company-0 @-@ type company who take our money and fail in their goal .
they lay off -CONST--0 employee , but give big raise to executive .
another scam that the media will ignore .
after see those bus tour to NE_company-0 execs home , promote on NE_organization-0 's website , i be wonder ENT_amr-unknown-0 those same people be n't outraged at this .
maybe because it would look bad for the guy who promise to pay -CONST--0 mortgage , put gas in their tank , give them free cell phone and increase the welfare roll .
of course , the people on the NE_company-0 bus tour likely do n't get soak with high tax to pay for this scam , so ENT_amr-unknown-0 should they care ?
this be not surprising or shock to me .
NE_person-0 must pay off his supporter by way of cash infusion and call it " stimulus " money .
he be not lie to call it stimulus .
it stimulate others to be big contributor so they may be in on the next wave of free cash from the boy king .
another victory for the left because there be more people in need .
the government will rush in and show these people that ENT_government-organization-0 dependency be better than work and provide for themselves .
that be the plan with all the liberal policy .
no one should be expect to practice self sufficiency or concern themselves with personal responsibility .
increase the welfare roll till the taker outweigh the giver . only then can socialism creep in .
everything NE_person-0 have do be straight from NE_person-1 's NE_book-0 . all of it .
if some on the left want to remain ignorant and not read alinky 's book to prove it , that be on them .
for those in the know , this be all quite predicable .
dumb , dumb dumb...
i 've always be a critic of judge who decide they be go to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these thing , but here 's a case where they do it the right way ,
they pass a bill , and NE_person-0 decide he 's stull suck up to be NE_person-1 's run mate .
NE_person-0 be be set up on this one and the ENT_government-organization-0 call his bluff
it will make him a big shot with the NE_political-party-0 in -CONST--0 but by -CONST--1 if he be to run for president " NE_person-0 veto gay marriage " will be a millstone around his neck .
by -CONST--0 most NE_country-0 will have gay marriage available .
christies denial of marriage privleges to gay will alienate independent and NE_person-0 " i want to have the people vote on it " will ring hollow
it be NE_person-0 that be the by far major nonromney candidate and NE_person-1 would appear to be the spoiler .
when the situation be reverse NE_person-0 argue that NE_person-1 be help NE_person-2 get the nomination and for the good of the conservative cause NE_person-3 should drop out .
now that the same logic would apply to NE_person-0 drop out , should he ?
sure , ENT_amr-unknown-0 not .
i think NE_person-0 be go to be the last of the " not romneys ", and NE_person-1 have have his moment .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 know . he may make a comeback .
of course money be a problem for him so he may have to drop out .
NE_person-0 or NE_person-1 . i could vote for either one .
no , ENT_amr-unknown-0 should he ?
he be , if nothing else , insure that he 'll be able to sell book after the election .
i mean you do n't really think that any of these guy really give a shit about their party or their nation , do ya ?
more than they care about themselves , i mean .
americans ' assessment NE_country-0 NE_government-organization-0 have hit a new low , with -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 say they approve of the way NE_government-organization-1 be handle -CONST--1 job .
the -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 disapproval rate be also the worst NE_research-institute-0 have measure in more than -CONST--1 year of track NE_government-organization-0 job performance .
ever notice that the more gridlock there be , the more NE_government-organization-0 ' rating go down .
in other word , NE_government-organization-0 should stop all the politcal bicker , put their head together and start working thing out in a real bi @-@ partisan format .
it work for NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 and look at the positive result .
i 'm not the least bit surprise .
i 'm still wait for NE_person-0 to drain the damn swamp .
today on the NE_government-organization-0 floor NE_person-0 say healthcare premium will not go down and that the NE_government-organization-1 need to quit say that ! !!!
then NE_person-0 in the NE_government-organization-0 say we need to pass the NE_law-0 so " we can find out what 's in it....."
the NE_political-party-0 be slowy turn NE_government-organization-0 into NE_person-0 's NE_festival-0 ! !!!!
the insurance industry 's own institute say premium would skyrocket .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 could they not ?
if you force them to accept pre @-@ exist condition and accept other insure 's currently not eligible because they cost too much , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be go to pay for that extra risk ?
you can n't legislate risk away . of course premium will rise .
the ENT_government-organization-0 be in campaign mode , willing to say or do anything to get this turd pass .
the joke will be on NE_government-organization-0 dems who be be promise a bill to " fix " the problem with teh NE_government-organization-1 bill .
anyone who believe that will happen be dream .
NE_person-0 will hang them out to dry .
1. end the war in NE_country-0
2. develop NE_country-0 energy independence
3. universal healthcare for all NE_country-0
work for me......
only if that mean it be over because we win .
and we will have some very strategically locate , large base to counter NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 agression for the next -CONST--0 year .
a good thing , but he will have to include thing he oppose , like drill and nuclear power , along with coal power to get there .
only if he adopt NE_person-0 's plan of mandatory universal participation .
which mean everyone , without exception , pay premium .
here be the thing that should be NE_person-0 's top priority .
#1 end the war in NE_country-0
#2 bring us universal healthcare
#3 repeal NE_treaty-0
#4 repeal the NE_law-0
#5 repeal NE_law-0
#6 bring NE_person-0 @/@ NE_person-1 up on criminal charge for war crime . ( send them to NE_city-0 haig ! !!)
#7 fire NE_person-0 !
#8 strengthen the NE_law-0
#9 abolish the NE_government-organization-0 !
#10 prosecute NE_person-0 !
ENT_amr-unknown-0 about ENT_amr-unknown-1 my favorite doctor quit because he be not go to take a pay cut ?
or just let the quality of his practice go down the tube ?
also , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be go to goto school for -CONST--0 year to be a doctor , with major student loan and only make a sub @-@ par ENT_government-organization-0 salary ?
i 'll tell ya what , if be go to goto school for -CONST--0 year , it would be for rocket science or computer engineer or something of that nature so i could easily make an above average salary .
last and most importantly , -CONST--0 never want to see any of my paycheck support some lazy person who do not work because the ENT_government-organization-0 pay for them to live their life .
i plan on vote against every single one of these dirtbags that call themselves representative .
our NE_government-organization-0 , be it the NE_government-organization-1 or NE_government-organization-2 , be a bunch of non @-@ represent representative .
its as if the NE_country-0 NE_person-0 once again do whatever be best for themselves irregardless of the consitution .
i say kick them all out of office , and then do it again every election for the next several cycle until they get the hint .
we be not happy , we are not gonna take it anymore ! !!!
am i the only one or be some of you feel like this too ?
i 'm not a NE_political-party-0 , i 'm not a NE_political-party-1 , i be an american ! !!!!
start respect my country , my consitution , and our national heritage or get fire @/@ vote out .
add your -CONST--0 cent people .
i 'll have a senator to vote for along with my representative , and NE_government-organization-0 NE_person-0 be not run in -CONST--0 so i 'll luckily have more option to vote for .
so far there be -CONST--0 candidate in the race that i 'm aware of , and i 'm not impress by any of them .
but hopefully somebody good pop up that i can support .
as far as my representative go , i can n't wait to vote against him .
i do n't vote ' against ' anyone .
i vote ' for ' the best candidate for the job , regardless of political affiliation ( unless , of course , they be un @-@ NE_country-0 , like libtards and neocons ) .
since none of the incumbent in my district will get my vote , i guess you could say i 'm vote ' against ' them , but i 'm still not comfortable with that term .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would NE_person-0 be without NE_person-1 ?
a lot of us , include myself , have have fun poke , jab , make fun of NE_person-0 , her lack of knowledge about the constitution , her appearance on NE_broadcast-program-0 , etc....
but at this late date in the race...
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would he , ( NE_person-0 ) , be if he do not have her as his run mate
imo.... she be help him more now , because he be hurt himself , more .
NE_person-0 solidify the NE_political-party-0 base for NE_person-1 .
she invigorate the far right winger to actually go out and campaign for NE_person-0 , instead of apathetically vote for NE_person-1 to spite NE_person-2 .
NE_person-0 be the real star behind the NE_political-party-0 ticket this year .
if it be anyone else , NE_person-0 would not have a shot in hell .
NE_person-0 invigorate NE_person-1 's campaign , and she be one of the reason NE_person-2 raise $ -CONST--0 dollar in -CONST--1 .
when i see her speech at the convention , i immediately sent NE_person-0 as much money as i could .
presidential candidate : NE_person-0 ( c ) NE_political-party-0 NE_person-1 ( l ) NE_political-party-1 NE_person-2 ( r ) NE_person-3 ( g ) NE_political-party-2 NE_person-4 ( i ) NE_political-party-3 NE_person-5 ( d )
look like women have a candidate run for president .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be n't women flock to her ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 's wrong with the NE_political-party-0 ?
the woman be a nutjob .
she would make NE_person-0 NE_person-1 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 on earth would women vote for the NE_political-party-0 just because they have a female candidate ?
sorry , i would n't have vote for NE_person-0 , either .
i would vote for NE_person-0 or NE_person-1 .
the NE_political-party-0 for the libtards who be too crazy even for other libtards .
if the ENT_government-organization-0 provide health care , whether spell out in this bill or not , it will ration the care .
that be how it work .
the ENT_government-organization-0 can not afford to pay for everything for everyone , even if ENT_government-organization-1 take all our money .
and in fact the research that back up this health care bill out of the NE_government-organization-0 spell it out clearly .
specifically it identify the elderly and those under the age of -CONST--0 as be less important and so they will be the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 to suffer from reduce service .
know that the ENT_government-organization-0 can not efficiently run anything , i can promise it won't end there .
since all healthcare be ration , the question for me be do i want those decision to rest with corporation whose sole reason for existence be to make a profit --- profit which depend upon insure the healthiest among us , and deny coverage for those whom they may have to pay claim ?
corporation where profit be dependent on not provide the service i pay for ?
that can at any point in time decide to cancel my policy , leave me without any coverage at all and no prospect of obtain coverage on my own ?
that spend -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 of their revenue in administrative overhead ?
i have not see much cold weather , or snow , here in the northeast .
meterologist say this will be a warm than usual winter this year .
many temperature have be above what be normal for this time of year .
be this winter weather go to be what winter will be like in the future.?
warm temperatures.?
be ENT_amr-unknown-0 global warm be about.?
hey stupid , NE_state-0 's get -CONST--0 @-@ -CONST--1 inch of snow tonight .
when it snow in -CONST--0 it be global warm too
52 nd NE_street-0 all up in the white .
i see NE_person-0 . thank for let me know .
whats the name of that motor cycle gang you belong to ? ?
its warm , therefore global warm
it 's snow , therefore global warm
ENT_amr-unknown-0 will it be too late to do anything about global warm ?
have we already guarantee our doom ?
so you be a warmist too ehh ?
sorry to hear .
the facts.... from about -CONST--0 to -CONST--1 we have a -CONST--2 @/@ -CONST--3 of a degree warm period .
this start the man make global warm claim .
another inconvenient fact for the man make global warm crowd . since -CONST--0 until today there have be no significant warm .
a further fact . in the early -CONST--0 's scientist predict that over the next -CONST--1 year the ENT_temperature-quantity-0 would go up globally about -CONST--2 degree . and that be what it do .
so we have an -CONST--0 year trend that see a rise of -CONST--1 @/@ -CONST--2 of a degree world wide . follow to date by a -CONST--3 year period with no appreciable warm . remind me again ENT_amr-unknown-0 we be all doom ?
experience the great platonic year .
precission of the NE_planet-0 equinox refers to the NE_planet-1 's axis wobble move in an unconventional way .
ENT_temporal-quantity-0 period event be a -CONST--0 yrs wobble path .
notice the ice cap weight shift it be due to NE_planet-0 own inertia and the sun moon alignment .
this vid indicate inertia shift in ice not to be due to global warm but due to physic of the NE_planet-0 , sun , moon system .
this inertia of the sun NE_planet-0 moon generate potential physical plate movement on NE_planet-1 , ie earthquake .
very cool stuff .
so be this because of global warm or be it NE_person-0 's fault ?
it 's a good thing the polar ice cap be shrink then right ?
this seem to explain the record snow fall in NE_country-region-0 and NE_state-0 .
nobody as yet really understand why periodically NE_planet-0 undergo geomagnetic reversal . but the wander magnetic pole seem to have be happen for the last -CONST--0 year .
happen regularly , and seem to have little effect on the biosphere as a whole .
no unusual event in the NE_era-0 record seem to be associate with magnetic reversal .
but everyone know that what man make doesnt count huh ?
not , i suspect , as it relate to magnetic pole shift or drift .
you just know that some ignorant fool be go to blame pollution .
this be really eye open .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the environmentalist ?
have you see the trash along the road and in the ditch across this county ?
i see chair couch refrigerator and who know what else out here in the countryside .
people have no respect for their neighbors and i be talk about NE_country-0 here .
if they have no respect for their neighbors or fellow countrymen ENT_amr-unknown-0 can they have respect for themselves ?
its not everybody but a small segment of our society but the question be ENT_amr-unknown-0 small be this segment ?
now that be precisely what i be referring to .
instead of focusing on the filthy habit of illegals violate our border , you go one a mission to deflect .
not today , pal .
stay on point !
whole apartment be shake .
far out and funky !
ENT_amr-unknown-0 the hell ?
NE_person-0 say he feel this too in pa .
nothing here in NE_city-0 though .
do you think earthquake at first ?
felt it here just outside of NE_city-0 , pa !
thought i be have a seizure or something at first , till i see the water in my water bottle sway back and forth .
the book shelf in my computer room be move back and forth .
weird dude .
was go on for like -CONST--0 second .
the time of water war be upon us with the privatization of water resource worldwide by multinational conglomerate who be not accountable to , or suppressible by the local population they effect , even here in NE_country-0 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 say you ?
' NE_documentary-0 on what the privatization of water really mean which be the inspiration for me create this thread .
it bring to light the insane and completely immoral behavior of water corporation ( NE_company-0 , NE_company-1 , NE_company-2 , as well as NE_company-3 and NE_company-4 , and their involvement with the NE_organization-0 ) ...
i be never go to buy another NE_company-0 , NE_company-1 , or NE_company-2 product until...
i be die of thirst , which be the situation many in the world find themselves in now .
allow the privatization of public water source be stupid beyond all understand .
water be resource of the commonweal and ought never to be allow to become capture by any private concern .
right now corporation like nestle be buy up the world 's best spring to make bottle water .
allow this to happen be a perfect example of how pervert our ENT_government-organization-0 have become .
hey........30 year ago , i be read about all kind of hysterical doomsday theory of the extinction of this natural resource or that natural resource .
you get a few decade down the line and realize there be lot of smart people out there who roll out hysterical theory because they know there be -CONST--0 of sucker out there who 'll buy it in a heartbeat and profit handsomely ftw ! !!
my wife work with the NE_government-organization-0 a lot and she send this report over to me .
they report on just how difficult it will be to regulate the amount of NE_small-molecule-0 be release .
-CONST--0 : //www.gao.gov/new.items/d10818.pdf
of course it will be difficult .
the energy company be put many , many -CONST--0 of dollar into prevent anything at all from be done .
but we will probably start do it well after it will make no differance .
our grandchild will curse the blindness and greed of this generation .
i go to NE_publication-0 and check out the NE_world-region-0 oil crisis : all of the post be -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 old , or older...
how ENT_amr-unknown-0 -CONST--0 people post on NE_publication-0 ?
the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 -CONST--0 month there be -CONST--1 of private citizen with their video cam report about what be happen in the gulf... show everyone firsthand eyewitness account of the incompetence of NE_company-0 and the lack of ENT_government-organization-0 response .
now there be none : zero : nobody have post -CONST--0 single video on NE_publication-0 about the NE_world-region-0 oil crisi for -CONST--1 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
this stink to high heaven .
do n't tell me nobody have post anything on the NE_world-region-0 crisis for -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 : there be a media bl ; ackouit go on .
the last time something like this happen that i know of ; be the NE_political-party-0 convention in NE_city-0 for the renomination of NE_person-0 for a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 term in office .
would n't that be a NE_publication-0 blackout , then ?
i mean , rather than a media blackout ?
NE_world-region-0 oil spill - google search = plenty of coverage about the oil spill still on the media .
that 's the point : the oil have not be clean up : its sunk below the surface : just like all the true fact have sunk out of sight .
the dispersant they use , NE_dispersant-0 ; have destroy all possibility of clean up the oil because it 's make the oil sunk below the surface .
NE_company-0 's use of corexit be a quick way of sweep the problem under the carpet : idiot who do n't see the oil on the surface will assume that there be n't any ecological damage go on .
instead , the ecological damage to the entire area be now a -CONST--0 time worse than it be when the oil be still on the surface .
the oil beneath the surface : -CONST--0 and -CONST--1 of gallon of oil be kill all wildlife , all the fish , all the dolphin , all the crab , all the shrimp , everything .
to people who do n't live there : the horror of this catastrophe make worse by NE_company-0 cannot be understate enough .
yes you read that correctly....lets just assign a number because we want too !
yeah that 's the ticket !
these clown commit this fraudulent behavior all the fricking time and NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 , NE_person-3 and a whole host of others ignore this .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be so distort in their fundamental makeup that they can see this desecration of science and ignore it ?
in fact they support and revere it .
bizarre .
yes , they have be extrapolate temp for area where they have no direct measurement . however , as they state , one should use the NE_organization-0 measurement for those area , if very accurate measurement be desire .
yet , for all of NE_person-0 yap , none of this change the fact that the warm continue , and differant agency have better accuracy in some place than others , depending on the method use .
another item concern NE_person-0 .
he be not a meteorologist .
he be a fraud in that department .
tomorrow , the NE_publication-0 come out and as usual , there will be idiot claim the government do n't count people not receive unemployment benefit , or that the ENT_government-organization-0 be n't count people who should be count etc.
so let 's discuss .
question : ENT_amr-unknown-0 exactly do we want to measure and ENT_amr-unknown-1 ?
answer : we want to measure the labor market and how it be change , especially how difficult it be to get a job .
first difficulty be that not everyone can freely participate in the labor market .
there be law and barrier afffecting group of people .
while children can work , there be significant restriction as to field , hour , change job etc.
at approx age -CONST--0 the restriction be go , almost all job be open for full or part ENT_temporal-quantity-0 work .
so we ignore anyone under -CONST--0 .
next group be prisoner . while some " work " it 's not really a labor market system and work or not work be not free choice of entry and exit .
so we ignore prisoner .
next group be those mentally or physically incapable of work .
while many disable and those with psychological condition do work , those who be institutionalize or in long term care ( such as a hospice ) can n't .
so we ignore those in an institution or long term care .
there remain many disable who can n't work but be n't in an institution , but since some can and some can n't work , there 's no bright line , so we include them all .
next : retirees .
many country exclude those over the age of -CONST--0 .
for a country with mandatory retirement , or generous ENT_government-organization-0 pension , that be sensible as almost all those over 65 do n't need to work and do n't work and include them can distort the picture .
but in the NE_country-0 , there be no mandatory retirement ( except in military/police ) and retirement benefit be not as generous or universal .
so no maximum age limit for us .
last , military . for a while , they be count as employ ( -CONST--0 @-@ -CONST--1 ) but since there 's no free exit and it 's not a market system , include them just raise the number of employ by a fairly constant level , so it 's better to exclude the military .
so we have our population : the adult civilian non @-@ institutional population .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do we divide that up ?
the key be to be as objective as possible .
since we have to use a survey ( it 's just not possible to do a full count every ENT_temporal-quantity-0 ) , any subjectivity will increase our error , so we have to avoid any possible overlap or judgement call .
let 's look at employ .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be employ ?
some have suggest a minimum number of hour work , but be that a good idea ?
plenty of people voluntarily work few hour , or in a particular week only work a few hour . should we say they do n't really have a job or be n't really work ?
that 's very subjecive . we do n't want to run into case be someone nomrmally work -CONST--0 hour -CONST--1 week , but in the particular week of the survey she only work -CONST--2 hour and count as unemployed .
so we set a bright line of -CONST--0 hour for pay , and also include those as employ people temporarily absent due to brief illness , injury , vacation , strike , bad weather etc.
we can always look at sub group later .
unpaid labor .
some people do n't get pay ( directly ) for work , either charity work or work on a family farm or family business .
let 's not include charity work , because that 's not really part of the labor market .
but family business @/@ farm be a different story...the person be either just help out , ( mean if they do n't already have another job they would n't take one if they be n't work for family and @/@ or no one would have to be hire in their place ) or they be a substantial part of the business prevent them from another job and fill a job slot no one else can take .
so let 's set a bright line of -CONST--0 hour -CONST--1 week and anyone work without pay on family business farm -CONST--2 hour or more -CONST--3 week be employ .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 about someone hire but not yet work ?
many thing can happen , so we won't call them employ until they 're actually work .
now for the unemployed .
in casual usage , this can mean many different thing , but what we want be a precise , objective definition .
and what we 're look for be available worker who be n't work .
this have an impact on the labor market..supply over demand .
some people do n't want to work...retirees , housewives/husbands , full time student , and some people on drug or alcohol or criminal or lazy .
so let 's not count anyone who do n't want a job .
should we count everyone who say they want a job ?
they could be lie .
they could be unable to take a job if offer ( mean they 're not available labor ) .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 bright line can we set ?
if someone be actually look for work , send a resume , go to an interview , on the union list , then we can safely assume that they be really available for work .
but if someone be n't do anything about a get a job , then they 're not available , anymore than someone who do n't want to work .
sure they may still consider themselves " unemployed " and they may sincerely want to work , but since they 're not available , since they 're not part of the actual supply of labor and can n't be hire , we exclude them .
so we have our employ , we have our unemployed....this be our labor force , our available supply of people who can work or be hire .
everyone else be not in the labor force .
since the population tend to grow , for an historical comparison , it 's better to look at rates/ratios/percentages to get a clearer picture .
labor force participation rate : the labor force as a percent of the population .
this can be largely affect by non @-@ economic factor as the increase of women into the labor force in the 60 s and 70 s show , but it give a good look at how much of the population be try to work .
employment @-@ population ratio : this tell us the percent of the population that 's actually work .
again , non @-@ economic factor play a role but look at the change can tell us useful thing .
unemployment rate : unemployed as a percent of the labor force .
this tell us how much of available labor...people willing and able and available to work... be not be use .
this be all economic factors...the percent of people try and fail to get a job .
do this give a complete picture of the labor market ?
of course not...it 's not meant to .
it do n't tell us type of job , if people be work as much as they want to , people who do n't believe they would be successful .
but it tell us what -CONST--0 're look for : the percent of people who we know for sure cannot get a job .
i think that explain the basics .
i 'll be happy to clarify question or discuss any real issue .
the issue be simple , when 150k job be create and you need 250 to maintain...
yet the ue rate go down.2 ENT_percentage-entity-0 then you have a choice...
you can make believe thing be get better or you can understand that thing be get worse and deal with it .
you choose to make believe .
neither side expect the other to be consistant .
i remember the libs make this argument during the NE_person-0 year .
of course , the real cuteness be during the NE_person-0 year during the run up to the -CONST--0 election when the military be add to the employ part of the picture .
presto , -CONST--0 more employed person and the unemployment rate when down by a substantial fraction .
that get quietly reverse after the election .
what be important here be that unemployment be no long the short term thing it have usually be .
we have people look for work who have be look for -CONST--0 year or more .
we have folk just plain resign from the work force and do n't look any more .
people who -CONST--0 year ago have successful career .
even under the regime of -CONST--0 week unemployment rather than -CONST--1 week , we have large number who have go beyond benefit .
to maintain ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
and do " it " need to be maintain ?
or you can do actual analysis of the data .
" job " come from the NE_publication-0 ( ces ) while unemployment ( and total employment ) come from the NE_publication-1 ( cps ) .
the NE_thing-0 be non @-@ farm payroll employment . it exclude agriculture , the self @-@ employ , unpaid family worker and private employee ( private cook , nanny , maid , etc ) .
so " job " may go up 150k , but total employment go up 300k .
you can n't directly compare -CONST--0 measure that measure different thing .
much of the drop in ue have be for the wrong reasons...a decrease labor force .
that be not the case for the -CONST--0 drop .
at best thing have be spotty lately...up and down .
you can n't just look at -CONST--0 number or -CONST--1 measure and say " thing be good " or " thing be bad ."
the best unit of measure be , i think to determine how many NE_country-0 be work .
instead we get report on the number of people who self report they be n't work but be look for work .
to find out all we have to do be ask NE_person-0 and remember that NE_person-1 vote to the left of sander while in the NE_government-organization-0 .
NE_person-0 help us all if NE_person-1 ever get to appoint a liberal inflationist NE_government-organization-0 chairman .
oh , and we might remember that when their NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 , be ask about the future consequencs of his ultra easy monetary policy he say , do n't worry about the -CONST--0 , we 'll all be dead .
NE_person-0 : another very important issue be with unemployment so high , ENT_amr-unknown-0 can we strengthen the fed 's full @-@ employment mandate[ with inflation] and ensure that it conduct monetary policy to achieve maximum employment ? [ through inflation].
in other word the fed have a number of mandate and one of them be to control inflation .
but one of them also be to pursue policy that lead to full employment .
be the fed do that in an adequate way ?
well i would argue that by definition when you have -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of people unemployed and underemployed it really be not .
they 'd do exactly what they 've do since -CONST--0 .
lend out " money " that do n't exist , charge interest for it , inflate the hell out of the currency and line their pocket in the process .
then , they 'd bankroll endless stupid foreign war , the socialistic welfare state , massive NE_person-0 scheme , endless bailouts of state , city , corporation and foreign nations....
the same thing a conservative fed would do , and then they 'd call it brilliant and give NE_person-0 the credit .
an NE_thing-0 target can fix the unemployment problem without result in inflation .
that 's a gross misunderstand of the NE_person-0 quote .
what he 's say be n't , obviously , that we should n't care about the long run .
what he 's say be that economist be take the easy way out only ever consider the long run .
we need not only theory of the long run , but also theory of the short run .
nobody can " fix the unemployment problem " ....
this be the fatal conceit of socialistic central planner come out of the chute .
" global warm be real - it be man @-@ make and it be an important problem . but it be not the end of the world." - ENT_amr-unknown-0 say it ?
NE_person-0 - NE_publication-0 , the free encyclopedia
i think this issue be only valuable for the purpose of support commoditization of co2. that 's my explanation for why all of the fund scientist point to the gas and build the anthro argument . i dont see how it be credible in light of more dominant cause .
i 'm curious dante...dosen't the temp change by about -CONST--0 degree , every year , in the northern and southern hemisphere ? also , with warm temp and more NE_small-molecule-0 in the atmosphere , would n't the number and variety of plant and tree increase ? ENT_amr-unknown-0 ever happen to the rain forest , nuclear meltdown , ozone layer , global cool , or any of the other iminent catastrophe that will befall us if we do n't do something right now ! !? the only environmental issue important to envronmentalists be whatever one can generate the most money . at least oil company get their cash by provide us with something -CONST--1 need . you enviro @-@ whackos get yours by do absolutely nothing at all , except make life hard for everyone else .
in reality human contribute about -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 to global worm in term of NE_small-molecule-0 release into the atmosphere . yes it be true that we be responsible for this number and try to minimize it in whatever way we can , but human be not ultimately the source of global worm . it be arrogant of us to think that we can effect the ecosystem of the world in such a drastic way in only -CONST--1 year . science be divide on the issue with scientist in ENT_government-organization-0 lab report that global warm be an imminent threat cause by human and only we can save the planet while scientist at university and private organization generally suggest that man be not the ultimate cause and in reality contribute little . the NE_organization-0 have publish documentation and recommendation about global warm at regular interval and it be not until one of their more recent publication that they completely overturn their previous data show global warm to be natural in favor of new data that show global warm to be human cause . the problem be that they use the same relative data set and simply change the way it be view to maximize the human contribution . they have also be know to falsify information to suit their purpose and destroy information that prove them incorrect .
so it would appear that politics drive natural history and our relation to the ecosystem...inherent problem there .
consider too rapid climate change event as document by paleoclimatological data from ice core drill out of NE_continent-0 and atmospheric analysis of gas freeze in the ice . this heat process occur every -CONST--0 year like clockwork for the past -CONST--1 year that our record go back . guess what...it have be just about -CONST--2 years...fancy that .
remember in the -CONST--0 s when the next ice age be around the corner and we be all go to freeze to death ?
very simple . adapt to a rapidly change climate be preferable to change our present habit , no matter how destructive they be to the come generation , or to the rest of the biosphere .
for most people , the present rapid change be already stretch their ability to adapt . they see job that they consider safe niche now go forever , with no demand for skill that take ENT_temporal-quantity-0 to develop , and now the scientist be tell them that they have to change even more . that we should cease to use fossil fuel asap , that we need to switch to an energy base that feature nuclear , wind , solar , geothermal , and other non @-@ pollute source , that they do not understand , and have no experiance with .
i see otherwise intelligent people convince themselves of the scientific equivelant of the sun rise in the west simply because they wish to avoid any more change in the life , and the way that they live . which , of course , push the change onto their children , and grandchildren , who will be face a much more serious situation concern the effect of a change climate , a rapidly change climate , than we face today .
well , that be the culture of this nation , and our children will suffer the consequence of our inability to face reality .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 long would we live if we could replace body part with exact match ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 about replace our whole body and exchange brain with that of a clone ?
someday the micro surgery techiques will be available .
would you participate ?
i would if it be sure fire .
they be patent human gene right now .
perhaps one have an inalienable right to patent one own body and its specific type .
do we own our own uniqueness ?
your thought ?
interest book...last NE_book-0 woods...talk about how this generation have accept the merge of man/machine/animals....that there be about -CONST--0 patent life forms...
i be not real sure what that mean but i be sure NE_person-0 can explain it...
i find the idea of " cloning " sillie...
the so call " clone " be a human from your cells...not a spare part factory for you .
be there not still question concern the aging of cell in the " clone " animal or person...
that dollie 's lamb ( remember the NE_sheep-0 that be cloned ) age fast due to her age at the beginning....
so you would have to clone your infant...
now tell me....you have spare infant identical to the one you give birth too and your not gonna love it....
now that would be a brave new world .
would i be able to order clone of NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 that i could keep as sex slave ?
if so , count me in .
go ahead and slap a property tax on them too , i 'm good for it .
-CONST--0 NE_country-0 troop be kill when the NE_aircraft-type-0 carry them crash .
may they rest in peace and condolence to the family and love one of these brave young men .
-CONST--0 coalition troop kill this year ? man , that 's a lot .
i do n't realize the casualty be that high this year .
our NE_publication-0 do n't seem very interested in cover the NE_country-0 war much . i 'm really not sure why .
that 's bad but this be the unnecessary war NE_person-0 start .
this be war and people die in war .
over -CONST--0 NE_country-0 death cause by NE_country-1 occupation
this happen in -CONST--0 .
they be the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 and only -CONST--0 , i believe .
they do the same train , make it through .
that be pretty cool .
it 's like the " softest " branch of the military and the tough assignment together .
so these guy can be sit in a bar next to some NE_military-0 .
NE_military-0 say , " so ENT_amr-unknown-0 be you ? "
and they say , " we 're in the NE_military-0 ."
and maybe they snicker a little , but they should n't !
ENT_amr-unknown-0 make people assume the NE_military-0 be the softest branch ?
ignorance ?
maybe you never serve in any military branch and have no frame of reference ?
not to diminish the great NE_military-0 sailor who keep the gigantic ship run with all kind of technical skill , NE_military-1 people be the real sailor who navigate tiny boat in high sea to rescue people , arrest criminal and keep NE_country-0 's shore safe .
it 's not surprising that they could complete NE_military-0 train if they want to .
i 've be read through several news site tonight and i just pick up on a great story about a NE_military-0 pilot who probably save a lot of NE_military-1 life in the early going of the NE_country-0 war .
now let 's get one thing straight , i initially agree with the reason for go into NE_country-0 , but i no long agree with it .
i support NE_person-0 to pull our troop out by next year .
i always , -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 side with our brave men and women who be put themselves in harm 's way .
now today , i come upon this story on tv .
lieutenant colonel NE_person-0 .
he be promote to lt. colenel in -CONST--0 .
he 's part of the 325 th NE_military-0 off of NE_facility-0 fly NE_aircraft-type-0 's and NE_aircraft-type-1 @-@ 22 raptors .
he 's be in the NE_military-0 for -CONST--0 year .
he be just -CONST--0 year short of retirement .
he 's fly mission in NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 and have be await re @-@ deployment a new tour of duty .
if you know anything about NE_military-0 , he 's afelm jt fly trng .
back in -CONST--0 this hero win the NE_award-0 .
back in -CONST--0 , -CONST--1 the NE_military-0 be make the initial advance to capture NE_airport-0 , NE_person-0 and his wingmen find an NE_country-0 ambush site of about -CONST--2 apcs that be less than -CONST--3 mile from the -CONST--4 .
at the time , his wingman be suffer from a major malfunction in his plane that prohibit him from deploy his weapon .
within a timespan of -CONST--0 @-@ -CONST--1 minute , he and his wingman be finally able to deploy all of their weapon and destroy the -CONST--2 apcs that be about to NE_vehicle-0 the NE_military-0 on their mission to take NE_airport-0 .
they take out the entire enemy position and that night the NE_military-0 capture NE_airport-0 .
why be i post this ENT_amr-unknown-0 there have be several -CONST--0 if not -CONST--1 of other NE_country-0 soldier , seamen and pilot ENT_amr-unknown-1 have each serve their NE_country-1 heroicly and have also win medal , ENT_amr-unknown-2 some have even die for ?
because this hero be -CONST--0 year away from retirement and be be discharge , against his will , from the NE_military-0 . be this because of bad behavior ? no. he have an excellent record of service and have never have any problem . then ENT_amr-unknown-0 , if this -CONST--1 @-@ year veteran ENT_amr-unknown-1 be an excellent pilot of the NE_military-1 NE_military-2 be discharge against his will , -CONST--2 year before he retire ?
because he 's openly gay . he 's command squadron , save other NE_country-0 soldier ' life and serve with honor .
but because he be different than we be , because he be sexually attract to men , his sexuality trump the incredible record of service he 's have over -CONST--0 year .
are you tell me that the most professionally train , the meanest , the fiercest military in the world that can destroy any other enemy and accomplish any goal its give , cannot accept men or women who have different seuxality taste than other people ?
this do n't NE_law-0 absolutely must be repeal immediately !
men and women who fight to save our country , who be more than willing to die to protect our freedom , must not be discriminate against .
it 's time to end prejudice and time to accept human being for who they be - espeically our heroic men and women in the NE_military-0 . support our troop !
all of them !
in these troubled time we simply cannot do without this significant portion of potential enlistees , and talented senior member , to uphold an absurd , and bigoted , policy .
most absurdly , we be allow ourselves to fire NE_language-0 specialist , people whose position be critical at this time , due to a trait that have no effect on the performance of their duty .
i know NE_government-organization-0 have a lot on their plate right now , but they need to move on this soon .
preferably with a solution that would allow soldier lose to this idiotic policy to reenlist if they still wish to .
its not that the military be against gay .
the military be against thing that make it run less efficiently .
allow black to enter the military increase its number and productivity thus the long term goal outweigh the short term unease .
allow openly gay men @/@ women into the service would create long term discomfort and you would see a decrease in troop number as well as military efficiency .
because of the nature of the military and close quarter share especially among men in war simulation , train and actual warfare the distraction of have someone who -CONST--0 know may be attract to -CONST--1 can ultimately cause death because you be distract .
as part of the NE_military-0 ?
they do pretty much the same thing though the NE_military-0 have the much more elite unit and more highly train infantry .
the NE_military-0 , as demonstrate by its successful execution of NE_event-0 during NE_war-0 , be also capable of make dare amphibious assault , so why not just disolve the NE_military-1 into the NE_military-2 ?
you be aware that the NE_military-0 be the only service that be protect by NE_government-organization-0 act ?
the NE_military-0 must maintain a minimum of -CONST--0 division and can not be disband without a NE_government-organization-0 act .
this be do in the early -CONST--0 's because of reject like you .
because the NE_military-0 need bodyguard for the officer corps and a expeditionary force , too .
leave the fuck NE_military-0 alone .
they 're -CONST--0 of the few organization i still have some respect for in this nation .
to be honest , the NE_military-0 be a great service .
i have serve with several stellar performer from NE_military-0 and 3 rdarmored .
got friend in the 101 and 82 nd NE_military-0 or airmoble .
the bottom line ( and the hook and sinker ) be that man for man , and dollar for dollar the NE_military-0 cannot match the " kick in the door " specialty that our NE_military-1 do .
btw i do a force on force with the 10 th NE_military-0 in the late 80 's .
they be attempt to go @-@ light and be use our fmfm 's to teach em technique .
and besides , they aint ready to be NE_military-0 yet .
you just know i have to weigh in on this one !
each service and the NE_military-0 have their unique role .
there be of course some similarity and overlap between them .
that be what allow the NE_country-0 military great flexibility in operational execution .
fund will always be an issue .
each service think their requirement be more important than the other service 's .
because not everything get fund , we go to war with the military we have and not the military we want .
obviously , there have be interservice rivalry since the first ship went to sea with fight men on board .
the NE_military-0 have brotherhood beef with the NE_military-1 but we recognize that the NE_military-2 be a unique unrivaled infantry machine .
the NE_military-0 have the ability to meet any infantry requirement anywhere and be set up for long term mission .
the long term ability of the NE_military-0 mesh 's with the immediate ferocity of the NE_military-1 .
they be far from the same and if combine would defeat the purpose of their original design .
a funny story ( at least to me ) .
i have -CONST--0 son in the NE_miltary-0 corp , both of whome recently complete their mos train and head to their permanent duty station .
-CONST--0 of them go through mos school at NE_fort-0 , mo .
he be tell me that the NE_military-0 trainee 's have top salute the NE_military-1 ( no matter their rank ) ....
that to me show the respect that the NE_military-0 have for the elite NE_country-0 fight force...and a respect that would be lose if they be part of the NE_military-1 .
he also tell me that the NE_military-0 guy get additional pay for be station on the same base as NE_military-1 be not allow to go round in group of more than -CONST--0 , because they be concern about what they could do to anyone .
be afraid...be very afraid....usmc all the way ! !!!
man , ENT_amr-unknown-0 the hell can people do this ? ?
and a mother especially.....where be the motherly love and the mother instinct to protect her children ? ?
blind rage be just that @- blind .
i -CONST--0 find myself hold a steak knife @- ready to plunge it into my chest .
and i do , in my mind .
i be already dead .
but by some other force , i do n't .
i still do n't know why .
it be -CONST--0 of but -CONST--1 miracle that i 've witness in my life .
folk black out so to speak .
they black out to one singular vision that be a reality of past present and future . and for that i hold them ( and once myself ) harmless .
drug . NE_person-0 have over -CONST--0 different kind of drug she be take .
it 's a wonder she could find the bathtub .
neither one will go down in the history book as the best in theirsports............................
both be consider shoe @-@ ins duringtheirprime
i want to say something else too though .
-CONST--0 watch a documentary about NE_person-0 -CONST--1 , it be -CONST--2 that focused more on -CONST--3 fight career than his personal life .
my god , as a boxer that young man be simply awesome - and that be not a word that i use very often .
if i remember correctly he win -CONST--0 out of his ENT_ordinal-entity-0 -CONST--1 professional fight by ENT_ordinal-entity-1 round knock out , generally consummate by a left @-@ upper @-@ cut struck on the jaw that would lift a -CONST--2 @-@ pound man -CONST--3 feet off the mat .
its impossible to compare athlete from different era .
in golf alone the equipment be so much better now than it be even -CONST--0 year ago let alone -CONST--1 or -CONST--2 year ago .
its also impossible to compare the competition level .
i do n't think NE_person-0 be ever slate to be the greatest boxer of all time .
regardless of his skill , he never have the competition during his era to be consider the greatest
NE_person-0 defeat NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 , NE_person-3 and forman who be all better than anyone NE_person-4 ever face
i find out today that the NE_store-0 that i go to be closing down .
this be the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 store in my area to close in the last year , and i 'm actually a bit upset about it , because the few that remain be n't close enough to drive to .
NE_company-0 already drive the mom and pop videostores out of business , and they be be drive out by movie on line , movie on demand , and movie by mail @- business they be try to get into .
i guess some would call this progress , but i think we be lose something as well .
NE_company-0 be a simple version of NE_company-1 , in that you can still go to a NE_company-2 and browse and get a movie right then and there .
i actually prefer the NE_thing-0 because it do n't have nearly as much selection .
enough but not so much that -CONST--0 stand there for -CONST--1 hour , you know ?
all of the NE_store-0 around us close down .
you can get some great deal on movie @/@ tv show as they unload their inventory .
they drop the price each week so if you 're look for something in @-@ particular , nows a good time to keep an eye out for it .
also , when ours close down they offer a free movie ( that you be buy anyways , -CONST--0 think whatever the cheapest movie you be purchase ) and -CONST--1 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 free of NE_service-0 ( it 's like NE_service-1 ) .
you can just cancel before the -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 timeframe be over .
i take them up on the offer... good deal .
for me , part of the fun of rent movie be go to the store with your chick and pick them out , bullshit with other people in the store , etc.
god forbid we have to leave the house for -CONST--0 hour and move our limb .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 guy hear about a little boy be rape and dosen't call the cop .
the guy that notified his superior , who should have call the cop .
fire them all
i assume he assume after report it up the chain that something would be do .
i do though think the school make the right move last night , just wish NE_person-0 have be able to go out on a more positive note after what he 's do for nearly -CONST--0 year at NE_university-0 .
wish him a long and happy retirement .
how interesting be this .
some guy be go to tweet NE_war-0 in " real time " as it happen way back when .
i imagine you could tweet vintage ww2 headline ENT_temporal-quantity-0 but not much else .
the minutiea of such an undertake be indeciperable .
this quest be noble .
NE_person-0 have beat her predecessor NE_person-1 in a ballot for the federal NE_political-party-0 leadership by a margin of -CONST--0 vote to -CONST--1 .
follow event as they happen on our live blog .
2. NE_person-0 have say he would retire if he lose .
now be not the time to be bicker with an election come .
4. i 've be in NE_country-0 the past -CONST--0 weeks...
...where the NE_country-0 political story have be top news .
the local paper be of the opinion that , whomever win the leadership contest , the NE_political-party-0 be likely to be heavily damage go into next year 's election .
local NE_organization-0 activist be part of this protest .
file this under " holy s***!"
-CONST--0 of protester from various group converge on the state capitol in NE_city-0 , NE_state-0 today .
shortly before the protester arrive , capitol police discover a truck laden with explosive park outside the capitol .
yeah , this sound like bullshit .
-CONST--0 , the protester be not targeted .
that 's an invention of the blog reprint this .
-CONST--0 , i have a really hard time believe that there be any actual " explosive , " since the news story they link to talk about -CONST--1 guy get arrest for threaten governor NE_person-0 .
nothing about explosive charge , etcetera , which they 'd be quick on top of if there be any actual explosive .
given the way these story get exaggerate , " several improvise explosive device " could mean anything down to a few bundle of firecracker -- or nothing at all , since false report be n't at all uncommon .
doubly so since they apparently do not even bother to tow the truck , so clearly there be n't a serious threat .
translation out of hype @-@ speak : some kook make threaten noise at NE_person-0 and get arrest . the end .
of ENT_amr-unknown-0 am i try to convince you ?
i 'm express my own view here .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 you believe be of concern only in term of debate .
and possibly add to my knowledge if i 'm convince there 's justification .
so far , not .
if that article represent the final word on " substance " to you , that 's fine with me .
i be , and remain skeptical .
i 'm sure they find something .
hard to make any case at all without something tangible .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 it be , ENT_amr-unknown-1 put it there , and ENT_amr-unknown-2 remain , for me , unknown , and also remain decide factor for me .
wingnut @/@ hard for me to grasp . goodness , disagree with you cause personal attack . not hard to believe when consider the weakness of your argument .
this be excellent news , we need a counter balance !
it be reveal in -CONST--0 that NE_person-0 @/@ NE_organization-0 be create the right wing NE_language-0 version of NE_organization-1 .
1. ENT_amr-unknown-0 make u think these channel will be a counter balance to anything lol nt
2. because when all else fail , i still trust in NE_animal-0 !
3. NE_company-0 's NE_network-0 have be rate the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 most conservative news coverage .
still , a conservatively biased channel be preferable to a conservative propaganda channel , which be what the NE_channel-0 NE_language-0 channel will certainly be .
4. ENT_amr-unknown-0 be univisions coverage ?
i understand that it be a center leave network .
i turn on my coputer this morning and instead of open the internet to my NE_company-0 home page ( white ) it open to a page call " NE_page-0 " which be black .
i think , hmm , they do funny thing with the NE_company-0 letter for holiday , so maybe today be NE_page-0 wednesday or something .
i " blackled " it and find out they change the page to black to save energy .
do this make sense ?
any teeth to this and if so , do it make enough of a differrence for web developer to switch ?
i just googled NE_company-0 and when i click on the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 selection it take me to the white NE_company-1 page , so apparently we still have a choice .
the new search from NE_company-0 have the NE_address-0 , not google .
also , when we have a choice for skin , like i think we do ( or do at one time ) here on NE_location-0 , then we could all contribute to the energy savings by use the black skin , right ?
so , we could participate that way , too .
( although i find the black page hard to read.)
anyone familiar with the working of energy that could explain the black page use less ?
or , whether or not it be that significant ?
only so long as they have no redeem quality , i imagine .
it be always wrong to kill anybody , whatever they have do .
i hear it cost upwards of -CONST--0 dollar to execute -CONST--1 prisoner ; that sure buy a whole lot of year in prison .
a concurrent thread have touch on the the role of religion in the NE_country-0 civil right movement , and its place in the NE_country-1 constitution .
be the " equality " issue " religious wish fulfilment " which fly in the face of biological and sociological " fact " ?
i think you be answer if -CONST--0 men be the " same " and not necessarily if they be equal in right or should be .
t k o
i see equality as a goal to strive for , although in effect , it be somewhat arbitrary , dependant on the whim of change time .
while ride the bus earlier this week , i overhear a man say that if he " have the gut to do it , " he would jump off an overpass .
he follow up with an affirmation that he would never do it because he would never find those gut .
we be probably all familiar with the traditional say regard suicide - that -CONST--0 be a " coward 's way out ."
my question be this : be it really ? or be it the opposite ?
that be , do the act of suicide actually require courage to commit ?
personally i believe it require a tremendous amount of courage and perhaps the greatest amount of courage of any possible action .
after all , we be speak of terminate one 's own life , perhaps forever end one 's existence .
we all have our thought on what come next , but no one can be certain .
one may be forever end -CONST--0 existence , or he may be forever subject himself to punishment if the religious view on suicide be a sin be correct .
either way though , one be enter the unknown by willingly terminate his life , which blatantly violate the biological drive to live , to continue exist .
how can this not be an extremely courageous act , much more so that " find the courage to remain alive in the face of unbeatable problem ? "
remain alive to face one 's problem be continue the state of existence that one have always know .
end that life be journey into something new , something that may be better or may be worse than the current state of existence the individual be comfortably familiar with .
either way he be terminate his life and accept the state of death that deep down we all fear .
how can one consider voluntarily enter that state cowardly ?
@elmud , well , i think your reason have merit :
[indent]one be fearful of some thing one overcome their fear to do that thing in so do , one can therefore say to have courage [/indent]
so yes ; strictly speak , i think you 're correct .
although i must admit , it strike me as very unproductive to give praiseworthy word to such an act .
" he have the courage to kill himself "; though correct in this sense , lead to a ' destructive ' conclusion .
as a side note , labeling it as a " cowardly " or " easy " way out - i think - be simply people use derision to express their disapproval .
such disapproval may be certainly warrant - and i disapprove of it generally - but what one must go through ( mentally , emotionally and @/@ or experiencially ) can hardly be call " easy ".
i can also envision a state where , for me , such a solution could be warrant ; not a good -CONST--0 to be sure , but conceivable nonetheless .
to fight with every last stitch of breath for even the most @-@ remote possibility for " thing get better " be what i hold to .
interest twist on the issue . thank for post
@withoutreason , it be a purely courageous act , especially if you prepare for it so that it be least painful for your love one .
i do n't know if it could be argue as a logical choice , per se , especially if you have not yet try let go of all the thing that bring you down ( psychologically speak ) .
but , if you just get your arm and leg blown off by and ied , then by all mean , have at it . ( err...have someone do it for you.)
accord to most analyse , from within and without the petroleum industry , the world supply of oil , relative consumption , will effectively peak in the next decade .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do this mean ?
if demand exceed supply , someone will neccessarily have to go without .
the issue be ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
some nation will be price out , most likely the relatively undeveloped country in which automotive transportation be not really essential .
however , when there be not enough oil to satisfy even the industrialized nation , ENT_amr-unknown-0 totally depend on oil not only for transportation , but for farm , various chemical industry , etc. , ENT_amr-unknown-1 will they likely respond ?
obviously , war be a possiblity ; they have be fight for far less in the past .
of course , access to petroleum itelf be not the only issue .
most of the world 's food be grow use modern farm method that require enormous amount of gas .
if the amount of surplus food suddenly decrease as a result of peak oil , the poor around the world will starve , lamentable in itself , cause instability that could lead to conflict over scarce resoures .
NE_country-0 come to mind .
the economy of that nation be be build , with questionable logic by the central planner , on the NE_world-region-0 model : i.e. NE_world-region-1 on cheap petroleum .
what be unique about NE_country-0 be that the rule party 's legitmacy be intimately assosciated with rapid economic progress .
if this be suddenly to halt or risk collapse , would that rule party push the country into war , either to acquire access to oil or simply as a distraction , as so many authoritarian regime have do in the past ?
there be shift of power occuring in NE_continent-0 , as NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 exert their influence .
the NE_organization-0 of which they , along with ian , NE_country-0 and most of the former NE_country-1 republic , be memebers , have state that it intend to remove NE_country-2 influence from the region and failitate the rise of a ' multi @-@ polar world .'
i do n't want to guess their specific motive , but it seem to me that such an arrangement could be very advanategous for those nation in the event of a crisis bring on by peak oil .
between NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 , they would have access to enormous oil reserve , from which they could , if supply be too short , deny the NE_country-2 NE_country-3 come to mind as well .
as anyone who have do even the most superficial research on that nation would know , the NE_government-organization-0 be a joke , a paper tiger and a tyranny hate by most of its people .
if election be hold their , or if there be a struggle for power , the regime that woudl arise would be friendly with NE_country-0 and extremely antagonistic to the u.s.: quite understandably i might add .
with the largest oil reserve in the world , it be vital that the NE_country-0 maintain contorl over NE_country-1 , which mean prop up the NE_government-organization-0 , and it would be equally benificial to NE_country-2 or to NE_country-3 and its partner in NE_continent-0 to facilitate a revolution there , which would allow them greater access by default .
and so , after all that , ENT_amr-unknown-0 you might justly consider paranoia , my question be basically this ; in light of the threat of peak oil , and of the general decline in NE_country-0 economic might relative the rest of the world ( not to mention the current NE_country-1 crisis ) , ENT_amr-unknown-1 do think the world will look like in -CONST--0 decade or -CONST--1 ?
if NE_country-0 hegemony fail , as appear inevitable , ENT_amr-unknown-0 will be its replacement ?
nice post and important issue .
i really , really hope that alternative source be be as enthusiastically @-@ pursue as the urgency of the situation dictate they should .
but the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 , perhaps facetious , response i have to " ENT_amr-unknown-0 would happen "-question be to recall the 80 's NE_movie-0 , and NE_movie-1
i 'll admit though : there 's a part of me that want to see all this fossil @-@ fuel b.s. come tumble down .
even if it set transportation , technology and civilization in general back some , i 'd think a " reboot in a better direction " ( read : away from finite resource , fossil fuel ) be so much the better .
yea , more war over oil resource be likely ; perhaps even inevitable .
there be no question that the come century will see a confluence and will be a critical turn point in human history .
peak oil will be one of the primary driver of this process .
we may very well be call upon to choose between collective life and death .
the potential be there for both .
if we so choose to do so the technology we will have available in the near term future be perfectly capable of salvage the situation .
but if we do n't and we allow our technological civilisation to collapse under -CONST--0 own weight , the next generation of human will have to do without the major step stone of an oil based economy .
there simply will not be enough oil leave .
they may not be able to kickstart their own industrial era .
i think what you be go to see be a shift towards localize economy .
as the oil supply become smaller and population grow there just will not be enough to fee the system .
hopefully , people realize that it be go to take oil to move beyond oil , so the focus should be use what be readily available wisely , before the shift become extremely expensive .
i just read of NE_person-0 's death in NE_country-0 -- he be primarily know as a science fiction author , but his science fiction presage many of the technology that we now consider plebian .
his prediction of geosychronous satellite in the 40 's be now so utilitarian that this -CONST--0 hour equatorial NE_thing-0 be now know as the clark NE_thing-1 ,
many other of his ' fiction ' have now become casual technology .
i remember when he do that show " NE_show-0 " about enigma and theory about thing like NE_island-0 , great pyramid , and NE_facility-0 .
great man , great body of work , a truly enlighten soul who will revisit us again i 'm sure .
see you in the blink of an eye , buddy .
this be sad news .
i enjoy his book and his perspective on thing .
another giant gone .
shame nobody ( except a quoted person ) spell his name right .
i could n't for the life of me figure out ENT_amr-unknown-0 to post this question , so i think i 'd put it here since it 's biologically relevant... somewhat .
do n't ask me ENT_amr-unknown-0 but i need to know ENT_amr-unknown-1 happen if you dye your eyebrow .
say you want to disguise yourself by bleach dark hair blonde and that you want to do the eyebrow as well to complete the disguise .
now the hair on your head will eventually grow and you 'll lose the blonde @-@ ness , but ENT_amr-unknown-0 about the eyebrow ?
i do n't remember ever have them cut or trim , so would they stay blonde ?
eyebrow have a different " terminal length " than head @-@ hair -- that be , they grow to a certain length ( and not longer ) , then fall out .
they 're still go through the growth process , though .
the old one fall out , the new one fall in .
so it 'd have to be re @-@ done at interval , yep .
this excessive concern with little eyebrow be a trifle odd .
i do n't think NE_person-0 be look to disguise herself .
i think she 's on the vamp .
accord to NE_person-0 it be the male who do the vamp .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 's the scientific explanation of the reversal in human ?
its the same with long @-@ haired dog and short @-@ haired dog .
the short haired dog have hair strand that ( on the average ) fall out or break before the average long @-@ haired dog 's .
eyebrow hair grow much slower than head hair , so if you dye everything together , your head hair will show " root " long before the eyebrow do .
i dye my eyebrow all the time , whether i 'm do a touch up to the root , or my entire head .
so , that 's every -CONST--0 week .
i do n't know ENT_amr-unknown-0 fast my eyebrow grow , but after -CONST--0 week there 's always a grey one in there somewhere .
i guess they grow as fast as women seem to need to pluck them .
btw , when you 're die them , use a NE_product-0 , and make sure you get it all the way to the root .
i rather suspect that the " there be a god who always be -- and the god create what we see and can infer exist " scenario have more appeal forl you .
am i correct ?
a " theory " be nothing more than an explanation of know facts...when and if the fact change , the theory would be expect to change . therefore , any propose " theory " that be not support by know fact be to be reject . however , support for any one theory do not
automatically lead to a rejection of a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 or even a ENT_ordinal-entity-1 if those
theory be also support by the fact .
fact , not interpetations , be the basis for evaluation . an open and
curious mind and a regard for truth be still the basis for good science .
media coverage and political support be not .
it 's a common argument that the universe be tune " just so " for life to exist , and that any slight modification mean that " life " would be impossible .
but this premise assume that life as we know it be the only form of life that *can* exist . and i disagree with this assumption .
the life we see around us evolve in this universe as condition allow , so it 's not surprising at all that everything fit nicely . other universe with different rule would necessarily have life in them which fit that universe . and universe which be sterile have no life in them to question the fact that they be not there .
the really interesting thing to realize be that life evolve in universe ( at least this -CONST--0 ) at all . be the evolution of life in a universe pure chance , or be it inevitable ?
in our universe at least , life not only can exist , but do exist . and that mean that our universe be itself , alive , in a very real sense . and we be its thought .
a variant on the multi universe which seem to me obvious , and very real , be the infinite universe .
here the universe that we perceive be simply -CONST--0 cell of infinity , the others be like or unlike " cell " beyond our own , but fill the remainder of " everything " beyond our specific " this " with " otherthings ", identical , or not .
if we look at the magnitudinal stratification of this universe we go from , as we interpret it , and with our current ability to decern at sub nano level , the smallest subatomic particle through atom , molecule , solid , construct , and on , and on , and on , to planet , star system , galaxy , and on to our entire known universe .
would it not be foolish to assume this " NE_product-0 " like lattice would stop at the extreem of our meagre ability to observe , rather than continue to follow its serial makeup to unimagined level of structure , and beyond to infinity ( infinity , of course not be a point , but rather a lack of constraint quantifier ) .
multiverse
i be work on a research project on the concept of the multiverse and while i enjoy the incoherent ramble argument on whether there be a god or not im feel kind of empty . the universe be the way it be because if it werent then we wouldnt be able to contemplate on whether therte be a god or not . and try to justify the existence of god through anything deal with relativity be laughable . god be only able to exist through faith . and faith go against everything that science stand for .
a key issue in disscussion of " life " and " universe " be ENT_amr-unknown-0 constitute " structure " or " order ". for example , to take NE_person-0 's ( and NE_person-1 's ) fractal model of embed " structure " we be still leave with the regression problem of " ENT_amr-unknown-1 observe @/@ define such structure ".
my own conclusion be that term like " multiverse " have no separate reality with respect to a singular concept whilst the criteria for " reality " concern explanation of what we call " event " in the single universe . i be say that the occurence of " life " be not an " event " in the usual sense because event presuppose " observer " ENT_amr-unknown-0 classify them as such . ( observation in " our mind eye " be cognitive sleight of hand ) note also the term " multi " imply " one ENT_amr-unknown-1 classify or count " and we can ask again ENT_amr-unknown-2 be this other than ourselves ?
in short , the corollary the universe appear like it be because we be like we be be equally valid .
the transcendent question be of course " ENT_amr-unknown-0 constitute explanation " and ENT_amr-unknown-1 can this encompass the interaction of observer and observe ?
rather than take a reductionist view propose infinite , slightly different universe that somehow interact ( alah m @-@ theory ) , allow for strong emergence via the NE_analyze-01-0 of flaw in the of the NE_theory-0 argument that support reductionists . basically this state the final outcome of a system may not be soley define by outcome write into the basic law of physic * a gazzillion atom , but there can be " a cosmic imperative " write into the law of nature ( NE_person-0 - NE_university-0 uni - NE_city-0 , NE_country-0 - NE_publication-0 , NE_publication-1 vol 10( 2 ) , p1 "
so basically ultra complex system can produce wierd outcome ; such as rock , intelligent life or high temperature superconductors all from the same raw material - simply arrange slightly differentally . this might bring down the number of universe require to create life from infinite to merely fairly large !
can we -CONST--0 get these people a voice in NE_city-0 ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 long be we suppose to wait to see if this womans brain will ever rewire effectively before we move on ?
we NE_country-0 have let our victim fetish get so bad that we be pathetic .
if i be in NE_district-0 , i think this would be a fair question but i 'm not sure of ENT_amr-unknown-0 the mechanism to remove a congresswoman be other than the ballot box .
NE_person-0 be not all there but still hold his office with the consent of his constituent .
i think as long as her constituent be ok with it , we do n't get a say .
as NE_person-0 point out , NE_person-1 's office be do quite a lot .
that do n't seem incidental or trivial to me .
NE_person-0 be vote in because people agree with her policy and approach to politics .
she hand @-@ select this group of people who now make up her office , with the intent of work together to implement her vision .
in that way , she be still the representative , as these people take her state vision and priority and work to make them happen .
if NE_person-0 be unable to recover fully before the next election , i think it would make sense that her ENT_ordinal-entity-0 @-@ in @-@ command , or whomever have be most instrumental in the work that her office have be do since the injury , go ahead and run in her place .
i think NE_person-0 's point about not encourage removal from office by gunshot be a good one .
the member of the minority party in the NE_government-organization-0 be largely cipher anyway , although only a few of them have the excuse that they suffer from medically certifiable brain damage .
all the NE_political-party-0 in the NE_government-organization-0 could take -CONST--0 year @-@ long vacation and the result would largely be the same , so giffords 's absence from NE_person-0 duty be hardly consequential .
indeed , the country would benefit if more congressmen could be induce to take extended break from their duty .
it might be a good idea to keep track of this woman . some basics from her NE_publication-0 biography might be helpful .
the congresswoman , who be about to turn -CONST--0 , be born in NE_state-0 . when her parent divorce , she move to NE_state-1 with her mother . she work in a kibbutz after high school , attend NE_university-0 , the now defunct law school at NE_university-1 and the NE_university-2 law school where she take a master 's degree in tax law .
she have be marry for -CONST--0 year . " NE_person-0 and her husband own a NE_religious-group-0 counseling clinic in NE_city-0 , NE_state-0 .
NE_person-0 also have an ownership stake in NE_city-0 , NE_state-0 farm land . since the death of her father @-@ in @-@ law , the farm and its building have be rent out to a neighboring farmer who maintain a dairy herd on the farm . from -CONST--0 through -CONST--1 , the tenant @-@ farmer receive $ -CONST--2 in NE_government-organization-0 subsidy , chiefly for dairy and corn price support ."
initially a NE_political-party-0 , she become disillusion with NE_person-0 . in -CONST--0 , the NE_religious-group-0 documentary by NE_person-1 , " NE_documentary-0 live ? " impel her to take up an anti @-@ abortion stance and she and her fiance begin pray outside abortion facility .
" in -CONST--0 , NE_person-0 and other parent start a k @-@ -CONST--1 charter school in NE_city-0 , and she begin speak against a state @-@ mandate set of educational standard , which propel her into the world of politics .
NE_person-0 become an outspoken critic and opponent of NE_state-0 's NE_policy-0 . in a -CONST--0 column , she write : " NE_policy-1 alter the basic mission and purpose of k @-@ -CONST--1 academic education away from traditional broad @-@ based academic study gear toward maximize intellectual achievement of the individual . instead , NE_policy-2 utilize the school day to promote children 's acquisition of workplace skill , view children as trainee for increase economic productivity."*
* my reaction : what a surprise .
i love NE_person-0 !
with any luck , she will be the NE_political-party-0 nominee for the -CONST--0 presidential race .
a dream opponent for the dems , really .
now , if her run mate be to be someone name -CONST--0 , the dems could be in trouble , like , a NE_person-0 @-@ -CONST--1 ticket would blow them off the road once the campaign get into overdrive .
doubt if she 'd adopt an anti @-@ vocational ed stance , though .
all i know , be the more i see her on television , the better .
NE_publication-0 : -CONST--0 : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=iaadvod2srq
@33export ,
i 'm not certain that everyone will " get " the reference to NE_organization-0 . the NE_country-0 , however , will .
@plainoldme ,
it make -CONST--0 laugh ( and -CONST--1 ) .
thats only because you aint see nothing yet .
@maxdancona ,
my comment be simply a reply to the backhanded reference to NE_organization-0 .
imho , NE_person-0 be not as sharp as a bowl ball and have no business even think about run for president .
i love watch NE_person-0 be funnier than any sitcom on television . bad thing be she make NE_person-1 ronmey look very solid . i mean , compare to NE_person-2 and bachmann , NE_person-3 sound like NE_person-4 lol .
@jcboy ,
i believe that NE_person-0 have a real chance of beat NE_person-1 for the nomination . i think it will come down to the -CONST--0 of them , and NE_person-2 's negative , from be a NE_religious-group-0 to have take so many position in the past that annoy NE_political-party-0 .
a " selection of recent article on the NE_political-party-0 presidential wannabe and NE_political-party-1 darling ", from the NE_publication-0 here
@walter NE_person-0 ,
as amusing as a NE_person-0 candidacy would be , itll never happen . there be some intelligent people in the rnc who realize that this would be tantamount to hand over the presidential race to NE_person-1 without fire a shot . the rnc be scare that the public may love her like they do sarah.with the gop try to find NE_political-party-0 " center of mass " they be p[arading out these clown that can only cause them big trouble in -CONST--0 -CONST--1
it 's that time again .
politician run for mid @-@ term election be attack their opponent and in do so , stretch truth where ever they may be find .
i want to get a list of fact check websites go .
it 'd be interesting to see if different site come up with the same facts....
i figure someone should just start a website call NE_website-0 and just post pics of all the candidate , that would certainly make it easier
i 'm kind of cynical that fact even matter anymore .
we 've leave the information age , we be well into the opinion age .
that idiotic NE_political-party-0 " NE_publication-0 " be rip to shred by NE_organization-0 , but it won't matter because those who believe it ( or at least believe in the idea of -CONST--0 ) won't ever dare venture near a fact check source .
i think we need a new web service that fact check , but also track who come and read the fact .
you must have be read the NE_publication-0 , in which the NE_political-party-0 promise to return the country to fail NE_person-0 policy of borrow and spend and the elimination of oversight and regulation .
it be his policy that bring us a net job loss over -CONST--0 year ( ENT_ordinal-entity-0 in history ) , bank that become , in essence , hedge fund , sleazy sub @-@ prime mortgage loan , torture , corruption , etc.
moreover , privatizing NE_program-0 and NE_program-1 be a prescription for disaster .
( check with the brits who go through this relative to their version of NE_program-0 security.)
while the hostility between internal faction of the clerical regime and their feud over the sham election be escalate , the people of NE_city-0 , particularly young people , demonstrate in their -CONST--0 in different part of the city include NE_street-0 , NE_street-1 and NE_square-0 , vanak square , NE_street-2 , takht @-@ e @-@ tavoos NE_street-3 and NE_city-district-0 against the illegitimate and fraudulent election .
whereas i take every single word utter by NE_country-0 with a grain of salt the size of NE_planet-0 , even i can smell the stink from that election .
dear fellow NE_country-0 , this -CONST--0 th of -CONST--1 , while you and your family celebrate the -CONST--2 th anniversary of the found of -CONST--3 nation , there 's -CONST--4 party -CONST--5 won't be invite to...
...and that 's the party that NE_person-0 be throw at NE_organization-0 headquarters in NE_city-0 -- use your tax dollar -- for nearly -CONST--0 dictatorship , -CONST--1 terrorist state , ENT_government-organization-0 that endorse execution based on religious faith , and a multitude of other nation from around the globe .
you see , this party be n't to honor -CONST--0 freedom -- but to conspire to take them away .
over our -CONST--0 -CONST--1 th holiday , on NE_organization-0 soil , they be prepare to enact a legally @-@ bind treaty that would give the u.n. unchallengeable power to ban civilian ownership of all firearm .
that mean your rifle , your shotgun and your handgun . and your freedom !
to learn what you can do to stop the u.n .' s global gun ban treaty @-@ before it destroy our NE_law-0 right to keep and bear arm visit -CONST--0 .
just as a handful of patriot fire the " shot hear ' round the world " at NE_bridge-0 , it 's up to you and me and every patriot who cherish our NE_bill-0 to tell the world today that our nation will not be bully by the u.n.
thank you for act today .
throw ' em out , and drop out .
this organization have be finance with NE_country-0 tax dollar since its inception , and all it do it fee off of the money and try to kill the host . f--- ' em .
odd , such an extensive website about the threat of this global gun ban treaty , a dozen webpages at least -- and it doesnt actually seem to have a single link to the actual text of say propose ban .
do n't those NE_organization-0 member want to check out for themselves what the text actually say ?
do n't you think it 's odd ?
do n't you want to know what that ban treaty actually say ?
the treaty can be find here..
it seem that NE_person-0 be in support of criminal based on the what this treaty do .
try read the NE_organization-0 treaty when -CONST--0 sober up cj..
you might find it be n't even close to what you desperately want to think it be .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 make you think the NE_organization-0 let little fact like that get in the way of stir up fear ?
like the NE_organization-0 be go to actually demand that we close our firearm factory , and they be just go to lock the door because of this treaty .
lethal injection electric chair gas chamber hang fire sqaud
ENT_amr-unknown-0 care , would you rather have your hard earn tax dollar spend by keep them behind bar .
i would n't .
lethal injection follow by hang .
fire squad be probably pretty quick , but i do n't know that it 's use much .
the electric chair and gas chamber be nothing short of barbaric .
on the ballet i fill out yesterday , there be a NE_political-party-0 run for president .
i try to look up their website , but it be block at work .
so this even peak my curiousity even more ( as the other candidate websites be not block ) .
anyone have a clue ?
here be their mission statement .
interest - i have n't hear of them before and be curious .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 could have be so offensive that the website be block ?
NE_person-0 's view that affirmative action should , after these many year , continue may lead to his defeat in -CONST--0 .
and this may be the correct result .
affirmative action equate to discrimination against nonbeneficiaries , usually while male . NE_person-0 say he be against quota , but so @-@ call goal be invariable set up .
moreover , the goal be a euphemism for quota .
NE_person-0 should assidiously avoid the NE_term-0 and instead embrace programs the benefit the economically disadvantaged , regardless of race , gender , or ethnic origin .
depends on ENT_amr-unknown-0 it 's frame .
by far , the largest group benefit from affirmative action is.... wait for it..... white women .
affirmative action have be essential in allow women to break into some high pay , male dominate field .
many of these field be clearly still male dominate in the management area .
all NE_person-0 have to do it make the point , repeatedly , that NE_person-1 's position be anti @-@ women and he be for increase the role women play in the workplace and he 's get a winner .
what be tell be that even when talk about NE_person-0 's " defeat " the other guy never get mention .
if this prediction be true i would think one would consider it ENT_amr-unknown-0 's his name 's " victory " rather than NE_person-0 's defeat .
they can n't both lose...
the funny thing be that more NE_country-0 support affirmative action than oppose it ( this NE_thing-0 show -CONST--0 @-@ -CONST--1 in favor of aa for racial minority ) .
the conservative do n't understand that turn the majority of NE_country-0 into " liberal " be not a good electoral strategy ( as they see in the -CONST--0 election and will see again in -CONST--1 ) .
i 'm always surprise to see affirmative action discuss in term of liberal/conservative .
my brother , who be a general in the NE_country-0 army , self identify as conservative but be a big believer in affirmative action .
i self identify as a moderate liberal and definately identify as a woman am not nearly the supporter he be .
so i 'm just go to read along to see if the why of this be a liberal v . conservative issue become any clearer......
quota be racist .
there be no get around it .
they be a mean of make a choice based on race .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do it surprise anyone that NE_person-0 would support quota ?
NE_person-0 be n't against all racism , just some of it .
are those who question -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 anti @-@ semites ?
anti @-@ semitism be one of the most frequent allegation levy by defender of the ENT_government-organization-0 's version of -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 against people question that account .
be it true ?
are -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 activist really anti @-@ semites ?
not anti @-@ semites .
just anti @-@ logical
so out of the -CONST--0 NE_country-0 voter who say we need new 911 investigation there be no NE_ethnic-group-0 ?
not likely .
this post be based on the incorrect statement that :
" anti @-@ semitism be one of the most frequent allegation levy by defender of the ENT_government-organization-0 's version of -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 against people question that account ."
no. anti @-@ semitism be not the most frequent accusation against those that question the ENT_government-organization-0 explanation of -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 .
only when obvious anti @-@ semites try to say " the jews do it , " might that allegation make .
and , that i think be a version of -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 that be accept in many muslim country as the most popular notion .
unfortunately , anti @-@ zionism and anti @-@ semitism have be meld in the popular culture by many people .
so , anti @-@ zionists often become anti @-@ semites , rather than do the intellectual effort to parse the -CONST--0 concept .
i see NE_person-0 on a show this weekend .
when ask ENT_amr-unknown-0 no economist support her tax holiday plan , she say they be elitist ENT_amr-unknown-1 do n't understand the pain the common man be in .
just to review , NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 have propose eliminate the federal gas tax of $ 0.18/gallon during the summer drive season .
NE_person-0 say he will pay for it with spend reduction , NE_person-1 with tax on oil company .
NE_person-0 ( and all economist ) say this be a bad idea and result in insignificant savings .
there be no support for this in congress and the president have denounce it .
if the tax be repeal , several commentator feel the refiner will take some for themselves since they have also be hurt by rise price .
what burn me be the " elitist " comment apply to economist .
we tell our children to work hard , get a good education and become expert in their field , but if they disagree with a politician , they become latte drink elitist out of touch with the hard work common man .
be n't this just what NE_person-0 have do to the scientific community in miniture ?
be n't advice from expert require to run a country like the us ?
i 'm sure there be some economist of priviledge out there as well as some ENT_amr-unknown-0 propose solution based on theory without regard to the impact of their idea , but NE_person-0 do n't have any economist ENT_amr-unknown-1 support her proposal , so ENT_amr-unknown-2 's the deal ?
( i do n't know about NE_person-0 's belief since NE_person-1 have be do the heavy lift so far.)
interest i think , be the poll release this morning on NE_company-0 detail that -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 think the gas tax holiday be a good thing while -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 think it 's bad .
whatever , i think it 's just plain sleazy .
engineer engineer , i repeat my response on another of your topic .
i agree with you and NE_disorder-0 .
NE_person-0 's desperation " gas vacation " proposal be about the last straw with me .
she have really demean herself as far as i 'm concern .
it 's not only her pander , it 's that the proposal be so stupid .
the oil company would end up with the money by raise their price and the public would get nothing .
NE_person-0 for NE_government-organization-0 majority leader be now my choice for her . bbb
NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 be try to win vote with nickle and dime stuff ;
our economy be strain so badly , it need more than $ -CONST--0 tax rebate or -CONST--1 @-@ time summer relief from tax ;
it 's call a ) save home of -CONST--0 of family , b ) our economy , and c ) the war in NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 .
some dunderhead will fall for these gimmick , and vote for them in -CONST--0 .
i have go thru countless election and many thing be say in the heat of the campaign .
NE_person-0 once elect might go not thru with it .
that be not to say she lie but that wiser head may counsel her to pass it up .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be NE_person-0 ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 have he desert ?
his absence have be explain many time in many different way , but he have virtually disappear from the scene .
this would n't be so important , but he still be the vice president , be n't he ?
thing be look very muddled right now .
NE_person-0 , who be enjoy a limelight , be now be ask to keep a low profile , since his abrasive personality have alienate so many .
poor NE_person-0 , no matter how many time they parade him , still be n't impressive .
and NE_person-0 be begin to look like a desperate man in search of some dignity .
a lot of public appearance be leave to NE_person-0 , which be his job , but he do n't exactly have such an ingratiate personality either .
which do n't leave us very much in the way of impressive @-@ look leadership .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 be NE_person-0 ?
he 's in the underground command center....
he 'll resurface soon...
maybe he be in a cryogenic chamber right next to NE_person-0 .
in other word they be keep him on ice .
moonlight for NE_company-0
weird , be n't it .
i 've be wonder ENT_amr-unknown-0 he wander off to .
he 's be ' off the radar ' for a long time .
but he tell us all at the outset that this be the way it would be .
he be spend time in the bowel of NE_location-0 with his real boss , plot and plan .
yes and get rich by the day .
maybe a low profile because his name be now show up in arabic and NE_continent-0 paper regard that very same NE_company-0 bit ?
as NE_person-0 would say here we go again .
NE_company-0 be close -CONST--0 store and lay off approximately -CONST--1 people .
it be almost a ENT_temporal-quantity-0 ritual with the announcement of massive layoff .
president NE_person-0 on the other hand continue to claim the economy be strong , not as strong as it could be but strong nonetheless .
he have however present a package which he contend will stimulate the economy and create job .
over half of the package $ -CONST--0 will come by remove the tax on dividend .
what do you think of the package will it stimulate the economy ?
in addition if the economy remain sluggish ENT_amr-unknown-0 be NE_person-0 's chance for re @-@ election ?
yeah , it 'll stimulate the top -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the wealthy in this country , but will do nothing for our economy .
money must be put into the hand of the middle class and the poor for our economy to be stimulate .
the best way to accomplish that be to cut everybody 's tax by -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 effective -CONST--1 , -CONST--2 .
that 'll pump about a half trillion dollar into our economy . c.i .
well , i think it would be nice to see that title somewhere...since i can n't find it in reality....
it be wild to me how such an effective , strong , woman -- the closest advisor to the most powerful person in the world -- have garner no more support , no accolade from women and black -- -CONST--0 group who be always try to find successful sister or positive story of black achievement .
i have notice a distinct discrimination among women and black in whom they will ballyhoo , and whom they won't .
if any other woman in this country have soar to the height NE_person-0 have reach , it would be NE_event-0 -CONST--0 @/@ 7...
NE_person-0 be unwelcomed among his own race .
the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 black person to serve on the NE_government-organization-0 .
even if he have a disfigure pigment problem and a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 leg , if he be the slightest bit liberal -- he 'd have statue and street name after him already .
i hear a NE_state-0 mayor on NE_publication-0 today , and be hearten .
he be explain to the ( of course , liberal ) quizzical reporter how he could be a NE_political-party-0 .
it be as if he have to apologize to the entire black community...
i be proud that he tell the reporter he feel racially stereotype to be expect to be a NE_political-party-0 .
he should n't be expect to be anything .
it be to the great , abide shame of women and black to turn -CONST--0 back on the great achievement of these people .
it be the new racism ; by black against black .
the new feminist sexism . appal .
some liberal do n't much cotton to " uppity " black like NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 and NE_person-2 confront racial discrimination and outright racism and leave the plantation of dependency on white liberal and achieve the great thing they be capable of .
gotta ' keep ' em in their place , you know .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do women or black have to do with it .
NE_person-0 have a women secretary of state , and NE_person-1 do not represent black , so ENT_amr-unknown-0 be your beef ?
what amuse me about NE_person-0 be that she live in the NE_country-region-0 during the NE_event-0 , and that experience seem to have leave her untouched .
yet NE_person-0 mention that background as though she actually do anything beyond strive toward her own growth .
more power to her for her achievement .
but do n't be surprise if you 're not hear wild applause from her community , because i 'm not sure she have one...
assume she establish a credible name for herself as secretary of state , i be cautiously anticipate the NE_political-party-0 nominee in -CONST--0 to be NE_person-0 .
and yes , i think she can be elect easily assume that the NE_political-party-0 be allow something close to a level play field .
i think NE_person-0 against NE_person-1 or NE_person-2 in the last -CONST--0 election would have win by a landslide .
NE_country-0 , especially NE_political-party-0 NE_country-1 , have largely leave issue of racism and @/@ or stereotypical prejudice and bigotry well behind them .
any qualify person with charisma and a track record can compete with clout .
i keep hear that inflation be under control .
and i suppose it be if one do not need to put food on the table , buy gasoline , heat oil , electricity and many of the necessity of life .
from your prospective do you find inflation to be a non @-@ factor ?
did n't seem to have much effect on the last couple of yacht i buy .
now , i hear that high end house ( 1 1 @/@ 2 million +) be also hold the line in some area .
this whole economy seem to be based on the comfort level of the one referred to by NE_person-0 as his base .
lock up all scumbags .
lock 'm up .
make 'm work .
break up the gang .
if you get catch with meth , get to jail...
there be no unfortunate case .
you have dope its illegal , you know it be illegal before you have the dope .
and to whomever spoke of the innocence in prison , quit talk like that be the norm .
-CONST--0 %of inmate deserve to be there .
i will take those odds in NE_city-0 any day .
-CONST--0 pick NE_person-0 to be your vicepresident .
-CONST--0 read this if you do n't instantly see why... http : //www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1632736,00.html
he would ensure that moderate , libertarian , and technocrat sick of politics as usual would vote for you .
he be easily among the most competent politician we have .
he research and practice evidence based politics and thus virtually every policy he seek no matter how unpopular proved a success .
and he like you know how to balance budget without hurt the economy .
he can also pay for the election campaign .
i highly doubt that NE_person-0 be go to switch party .
he 's already an NE_political-party-0 ( switch from NE_political-party-1 ) .
but , offset NE_person-0 's " NE_country-region-0 elite " and " inexperienced " negative with NE_person-1 's " NE_country-region-1 elite " and " inexperienced " negative ? not so much .
personally i look upon this conflict as the source of -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of NE_world-region-0 @-@ muslim 's confrontation ,
the NE_country-0 need and so support NE_country-1 want to stop attack on its citizen and so strike on palestinian target , which in turn result in more attack on israel , this increase the number of radical muslims too , which result in attack against america around the world( military target , embassy , and citizen ) result in american foriegn policy like the war on NE_country-2 and @/@ or NE_country-3 , and the circle continue , reaction to action result in reaction , this circle have no begin and no end
be not easy to solve , but if we try to and start by the issue at core( palestinian @-@ NE_country-0 conflict ) the rest can be handle ,
i want to start a thread here , that simulate peace negotiation between -CONST--0 side , palestinians ( me and who ever volunteer ) against NE_country-0 side ( i suppose volunteer wouldnot mind represent them and any one he choose )
each side be allow -CONST--0 post per day , then after every -CONST--1 post its discuss freely by all for -CONST--2 day , then each side make a post , as the palestinian side be the -CONST--3 with most demand let let them start( if its ok by all ) ,
i need ur ok guy and girl .
very true , the same people who say NE_person-0 violate NE_organization-0 resolution , seem to forget , NE_country-0 have be in violation of un resolution for ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
give up hell , tell them to come get it ?
that go for isreal too , if NE_country-0 or NE_country-1 be anything worthwhile , isreal would n't of get what NE_country-2 do .
to the victor go the spoil .
glad i 've never back the NE_organization-0 .
NE_country-0 be NE_world-region-0 , civilize , the progenitor of the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 NE_religious-group-0 community , and face total annihilation every day of its life , thank to be surround by psycopathic state .
therefore.......we must back it . :headbang :
so you think if isreal stop retaliate , the attack would stop ?
no chance of that , they would chip at them untill they be extinct .
NE_person-0 go to the NE_conference-0 in NE_city-0 , and ask why none of them - who strongly support the NE_war-0 and the NE_war-1 - have bother to sign up and serve in the arm force .
unsurprisingly , there be plenty of excuse band about .
NE_political-party-0 get mad when the ' chickenhawk ' argument be bring up , and this be because it be damn effective .
they usually attempt to counter with some version of this line :
it be n't stupid , though .
there be a perceivable and significant differnce between those who discuss war , who think it be sometimes necessary , and who be willing to do what must be do for NE_country-0 safety ; and the war cheerleader .
the actively aggressive advocate of warfare as a solution to life 's problem .
those be the chickenhawks : the one who continually advocate the solve of our national foreign policy problem use arm force .
the one who suggest that the NE_country-0 be so strong , we can go it alone if we have to and we should n't be hold back from attack other country by little thing like , say , international convention .
they advocate use maximum force to win ; their problem with the war in NE_country-0 be that we be n't kill enough people over there , innocent include .
these people , who cheer on the death of others , who think that force be the best way to get what we want - but do n't sign up to serve themselves - be chickenhawks .
they be too cowardly to put their ass on the line , but continually advocate that others do so .
this topic be right on the money .
these leech and vulture be the one get rich off of the nation 's blood .
they stand safely back , say , " let 's you and them fight .
me ? i 'll cheer you on , while me and my friend get rich off your effort ."
there be a time when i strongly support the invasion of NE_country-0 , and it have nothing to do with present the good people of NE_country-1 with a democratic form of ENT_government-organization-0 .
oh , i also spend -CONST--0 year in the us NE_military-0 , from a ENT_temporal-quantity-0 when most of NE_military-1 have hear of NE_world-region-0 , through the period when just everybody could name each country in the region .
so , i 'm an oddball . s'okay .
yes , i would imagiane that NE_person-0 most likely did n't need the $ when he enlist but it be curious why NE_person-1 render the investigation of his death as a secret of national security .
the NE_country-0 be go to stab us in the back . if we do n't turn away from NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 to rebuild @/@ recover our strength . where they 're financially and militarily , bleed us to death .
fine , threaten to sell NE_product-0 equip ship to NE_country-0 if they do so .
if NE_country-0 be to do that , they would be cut their own throat .
the last thing that NE_country-0 want be a weak dollar because that would completely wipe out any chance of a trade surplus from their number -CONST--0 trade partner... the NE_country-1
a weak dollar mean lot and lot of close down factory in NE_country-0 because the NE_country-1 can n't afford their widgets and doohickies .
they will threaten , they will try to influence , but they won't ' drop the bomb ' unless they have a guarantee of some other country willing to buy several -CONST--0 dollar worth of junk -CONST--1 year .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think the consequence would be ?
do you think the NE_person-0 could pull it off ?
if not , why ?
his approval rate cannot sink , so , ENT_amr-unknown-0 's the risk .
after all , he 's the decider , and NE_government-organization-0 hold his trousers while he skinny dip .
do NE_country-0 want us to lose this war and cut and run as NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 have impose upon our president ?
do NE_country-0 want us to have to fight our way back in in -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 or -CONST--1 year with a death toll in multiple of -CONST--2 over a radically less period of time ?
also if we pull out of NE_country-0 and go into NE_country-region-0 what will be the justification for join that war , wmd ?
NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 tell the ENT_government-organization-0 not to fight NE_country-0 's war be like congress and the senate tell the government not to fight racism and the NE_organization-0 a few decade back .
these cowardly democrat be bargain that NE_country-0 will be stupid and not realize the deep war that will have to be re @-@ fought in only a few short year .
NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 will be the next war along with NE_person-0 if we do not create a successful democracy in NE_country-2 .
the power vacuum will in NE_country-0 pull NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 and possibly the whole NE_world-region-0 even NE_country-3 into an allied front against NE_country-4 .
this my friend be NE_incident-0 .
NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 have be tell this i be sure but they simply do n't care .
win election trump all other concerns...
do we really want these people set public policy ?
why not leave and let the NE_country-0 fight the war ?
answer : if the most powerful army be already struggle in this war ENT_amr-unknown-0 will it be like ENT_amr-unknown-1 we pull out and come back in -CONST--0 month to -CONST--1 year ?
NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 stop try to shove -CONST--0 partisan politics at our president over the general " sound " military policy .
listen to your bribe bibber NE_person-0 instead of our generals...
-CONST--0 friggin ' year of this crap be enough ! !!
if we pull out now the disaster will be on your head just in time for election...
the blood of freedom be at stake and the very people who claim to value it be now our own worst enemy .
the new democratic NE_organization-0 sell our freedom and dignity simply for power .
do NE_country-0 look to genius such as yourself for analysis ?
. now i know you be just kid , that attitude be just whacky otherwise .
there be ton of example in history of ill advise " proactive " war , and most of these be eventually lose by the aggressor
also , NE_person-0 , try to be civilize and dont resort to childish name call .
its usually a sign of an inability to craft an argument solely based upon the issue at hand .
just because you feel passionately about this doesnt automatically mean that others will embrace your opinion .
oh yeh , and , if you call me a coward again , ill come up there to NE_city-0 , hunt you down , and buy you a drink first .
i 'm think NE_person-0 mean what he say .
the day it become truly cowardly of one to suggest an end to mindless mayhem be the day i want to float off this planet .
NE_person-0 , you know its a cynical attempt at " spin " by the rapidly sink NE_ship-0 .
his " handler " be try to cover ytracks and leave a legacy that be goona leve his presidency up there with NE_person-0 or NE_person-1 .
( oy , theres a comparison , NE_person-0 , i believe start the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 of the ' proactive war " against the NE_religious-group-0 ) ,
people like you have do more to screw this country up than " the democrat " could ever have hope to do .
you repeatedly vote for and support a president and an ENT_government-organization-0 who be clearly and obviously incompetent and ideologically extreme .
this be evident from campaign through the early year of governance .
you think that NE_country-0 mean red , white , and blue and war and think nothing of shred the constitution on the way to more blood and glory .
and you dare to presume that you be somehow the " real NE_country-0 " and the rest of us , those of us who actually know what the constitution say and know what this ignoramus be try to do to it , be somehow go to destroy " your " country .
you wave your flag and trust an ignorant incompetent who can n't even run this country to somehow rebuild another , one that he do n't even begin to understand and have never be to .
you trust an idiot .
you think the answer to incompetence and mismanagement be faith .
you and your brethren , the NE_person-0 die @-@ hards , have send this country in a death spiral .
and sadly , the only people we can have any hope of pull us out be the " other party ".
a party that already be wane in respect due to corruption and its willingness to take some fundamental social justice concept too far be now support by a majority of the public , and the beloved party of small ENT_government-organization-0 and individual liberty be now a hulking rusty heap of corruption , scandal , incompetence , special interest , big ENT_government-organization-1 , and domestic spy .
maybe i be , and maybe i 'm say that you 're an idiot .
hard to say exactly . :wink :
you mean NE_person-0 and his sidekick " toady " be NE_person-1 , who be actually beat up by NE_person-2 .
i need to set these thing correct so that the record will be clear testimonyat NE_person-0 's sanity hear .
i be a conservative , and you be an idiot .
you said..
most christions i know will not bow to another god , no matter who that god be .
thats why so many NE_religious-group-0 be kill by the ancient NE_country-0 , they refuse to bow down .
also , to use an old cliche..." i would rather die on my feet then live on my knee "
i be read in the paper today about all the law under consideration that would make it harder for NE_country-0 to vote when -CONST--0 suddenly flash on all the purple finger NE_country-1 voter that be so celebrate in our press only a few short year ago .
i think i must be miss something because i 'm really confuse by this .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would any state do anything that would make it harder for it 's citizen to vote ?
-CONST--0 can someone explain this to me ?
that 's pretty easy .
conseratives figure ( and probably with justification ) that their voter base will get out and vote without regard for any minor hurdle which might be throw in their way .
they rely on older citizen and more affluent citizen .
anything which make vote more difficult they figure will reduce the number of voter go to the poll to vote for NE_political-party-0 .
i do n't have a problem with the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 -CONST--0 - provide that they make available photo ids at no cost to people with limited income and allow clear instruction and make it easy to obtain ( in other word - there be many location to obtain and enough hour that be vary enough to get these ids ) .
i support have ids to limit voter fraud , but you cannot make it difficult and it should be economically feasible for all to get an id .
i mean if you make the extra effort to go out and vote - it should n't be much more a burden to get an id .
the NE_political-party-0 must return to their progressive program , and must spend the resource necessary to remind the people that the NE_political-party-1 , the right wing , the NE_organization-0 be just plain wrong on the issue .
hopefully the NE_state-0 loss have make NE_person-0 go back on the progressive track .
what be interesting about the -CONST--0 party system be the people never actually vote for a party .
they always vote against the other one .
the net result be the people be misrepresent -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the time - but amazingly they be so dumb they can n't figure it out .
we ask you : to save money , should local ENT_government-organization-0 use nonviolent inmate for physical labor ?
that be the question in the other day 's opinion section of my my local newspaper .
yes : -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 no : -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1
so my qestion be this , should gov't turn to slave to save money ?
@david NE_person-0 , depending on country it be already do .
hard labour , chaingangs , prison farm voluntary work while incarcerate get minimal pay etc
the option as voluntary will at least not require quota and enforcement through violent means( beating ) or witholding of priveledges like food , bedding( yes bed ) or outdoor sunlight and isolation.( legislativ brutality encouragement )
the question be ENT_amr-unknown-0 kind of work be beneficial in a crime and punishment relate way .
some experiements be already implement in disaster relief bushfires/floods , comunity work as replacement for incarceration.( anti social behaviour treatment )
it really depends on the moral standard of the nation in question .
force labour in NE_continent-0 compare to NE_continent-1 or NE_continent-2 be implement differently
have'nt goverments @/@ corporation turn their populus trough a monetary reward @/@ tax system into work slave anyway ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 's your thought on this ?
i mean , the guy be -CONST--0 year old .
be it really necessary after all these year ?
he 's be here since -CONST--0 and never do a thing to any one .
be a nazi be what be expect of germans back then .
you and i , have we live there during that time , would probably have be in the same boat .
the head of the NE_organization-0 be name -CONST--0 , ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you expect ?
while i disagree with you that we 'd all be nazis , it be over -CONST--0 year ago , and the man have obviously reform .
expel him be a political move to strengthen the zionist stance through a reminder of the holocaust , and serve as a talk point for the anti @-@ NE_person-0 crowd .
so i be discuss that new tv show on NE_publication-0 , NE_broadcast-program-0 , with my grandfather .
he make a comment that be interest , he say , " that show be just the liberal media try to get us use to the idea of a woman president for when NE_person-0 run ."
now , my grandfather be one of those old , cynical guy that think that every sport game that do n't go his way be fix , and be a tad racest , however , i find the statement intrigueing and make me wonder .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be your guy ' opinion ?
i 've definitely hear that argument before , and i refuse to watch the dang show .
ok so i live in NE_state-0 and maryjane be just legalize in our state .
well all know why a state would legalize it , but do you really think that it can help somebody ? if so ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
think of any other drug that you feel may help someone .
think of this . when i be do crystal , i be in school .
-CONST--0 never miss -CONST--1 day of school .
when i go to my class tweak , i pay more attention to what be go on in class .
i go home do all of my homework .
i remember lookin at -CONST--0 of my report card before -CONST--1 start use and my grade be either all d 's or d 's and f 's .
then i look at a report card that i get that have all a 's on it .
i be soo high on crystal that semester that i do not even remember most what happen at school or at home .
so i ask do you think drug can be good for some people ?
i know that no matter what no drug be good for anyone .
this do n't mean that i would go back and change thing if i could , because i really do not want to .
i be just wonder how other people feel about this .
@secondchance , i think that drug can have positive but i think that they 'll rarely come without negative and whether or not it 's a net positive be hard for anyone to tell , most of all the user .
@secondchance , it be possible to self medicate to a positive outcome . responsible use be require .
for instance a couple of generation of artist have widely use drug , convince that the change in consciousness be of great help to their work .
we modern have no doubt but that it be a good idea to drug people up on NE_product-0 and anti anxiety drug and antidepressants , this highly drug society have no basis to complain about wee and coke .
meth though mess people up big time , so i do n't see a lot of upside to that .
yes , and i 'm one of them .
my life would be impoverish without my ENT_temporal-quantity-0 glass of wine .
i quite enjoy the few joint i have try .
and sometime , when i 'm in a better general mood than i be right now , i 'd like to try lsd or -CONST--0 of its relative , maybe magic mushroom .
to me , consume drug be a matter of moderation , not abstinence .
my wife have constant ring in her ear : noise , a " whooshing " as she describe .
any idea ? thank
@robc , that 's tinnitus .
she should see an otorhinolaryngologist ( ear specialist ; ear , nose and throat specialist ) as , if this be recent , there may be thing they can do .
i just watch the most fascinate , inspire , and yet heartbreaking NE_documentary-0 .
obesity be reach epidemic proportion in the world today .
be there a fat gene ?
science seem to think there be .
many people feel hungry every minute they be awake and fight the fact they know they be literally kill themselves with every bite they take .
-CONST--0 man in the documentary lost -CONST--1 pound !
yet , when he reach -CONST--0 pound he celebrate by have a hot dog , which turn into -CONST--1 , -CONST--2 , etc.
he now be morbidly obese again and be n't ready to go back into rehab at a center that have great success in help these people .
when i be younger i could eat virtually anything and not gain weight .
i 'm almost -CONST--0 and it 's not quite that easy for me to keep my weight to what be comfortable for me .
i be able to do it , but watch this video scare me . -CONST--0 woman in the video be actually -CONST--1 feet wide when she get help .
i have see show on tv where -CONST--0 year old children weigh nearly -CONST--1 pound all because their parent want to appease the child and stop their fuss .
do anyone out there have a big problem with their weight ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you combat it ?
be food an addiction ?
be over @-@ eat a disease like drug addiction or alcoholism ?
now , that 's a link ! lol
i think the problem and cure be psychological . they should spend more time on the psycology of it couple with the surgery .
oh , now there get into that part .
i watch that documentary on NE_person-0 a while back....too bad he 's gain some weight back .
but there 's always hope he 'll get back on track .
besides the obvious medical issue with him , i be disturb by the co @-@ dependant relationship with his wife .
at his worst , he weigh -CONST--0 pound .
he be unable to even roll over in bed , let alone get to the refrigerator or supermarket....
he could n't even get to a phone or a computer to order food if you put it -CONST--0 feet away from him .
so....who be feed his all that crap ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be bring it to him ?
she feel she 's show love by bring him to death door because he ask for ( or begged or rant ) for food .
and not just food....garbage .
i understand love for your spouse , but theirs be not a healthy relationship .
also , in the video , after he have get under -CONST--0 pound , NE_person-0 say " i avoid food with a lot of fat and sodium "....as he be snack on individual size bag on salt nut and potato chip .
in the scene before that ( after his gastic bypass and much weight loss ) , the wife bring him dinner....kentucky NE_company-0 .
" oh ", she say , " here 's your protein ", as she wave an extra crispy drumstick at him .
my husband love egg sald .
when i make it , -CONST--0 through out -CONST--1 out of the -CONST--2 yolk , and mix in -CONST--3 pound of tofu....he never know the difference .
( btw , he 's very thin , but have a heart condition ) .
wifey could maybe take some lesson from me .
doctor have tell me i have a full thickness rotator cuff tear and must have surgery or my shoulder will freeze .
look for information from anyone who have have it or with someone recuperate .
i have hear the recovery be brutally painful .
any tip , suggestion , etc. , about what to expect during ENT_ordinal-entity-0 few day , how to manage , sleep , any info .
i have it do -CONST--0 year ago at NE_facility-0 .
i have suffer low grade " bursitis " in -CONST--0 shoulder for many year ( probably a worn rotator cuff ) , until one day while work out -CONST--1 get a real , full tear .
lot of serious pain with some movement or any strenuous exertion .
my surgery be successful , but it take me several month to regain my range of motion in the shoulder .
i learn that the post op therapy be probably more critical than the surgery itself .
i be determine to restore the range of motion and to return to my old exercise routine , so i in effect take charge of the rehab program and make it clear to the therapist the orthopedic surgeon that i would n't accept less .
in retrospect i believe this be the critical thing , in that the docs . and the therapist take their cue from the patient -- if you passively accept less than full recovery , they will let you go .
if you be determine to go on , they will help .
i have full use of the shoulder and no more pain .
i would do it again .
i hope this be helpful and wish you good luck !
i 'm under erratic , severe stress in my personal life and my colorful , efficient adrenalin gland be play merry hell with my blood pressure .
i 'm hope to avoid drug by lose weight and learn serenity , but meanwhile i 'm suppose to monitor my blood pressure at home .
once upon a time i have a jim @-@ dandy wrist unit that work perfectly .
then after -CONST--0 year of faithful service , it up and die .
now the wrist unit at the local drugstore come with a read @-@ outbox that be too wide for my 5 1 @/@ 2 inch wrist .
i 've also try the wrap @-@ the @-@ upper arm monitor .
these only work about -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the time and deal with them send my blood pressure up to new height .
also , because of a lumpectomy i can only use my left arm for b.p. reading .
i 'm leave hand , but be make progress in non @-@ dominent @-@ hand dexterity .
can anyone recommend a no @-@ hassle , NE_thing-0 @-@ friendly home blood pressure monitor that will work around bird bone ?
NE_person-0 , from your post i assume you have not check on the model currently on the market .
most company have fully automatic model that do n't require adjust it to your arm with every use .
you adjust it -CONST--0 to fit your arm ( you can do this with it off your arm ; it might take -CONST--1 try ) and that 's that .
slip it on your arm . press a button and in less than -CONST--0 minute read your b.p. and heart rate .
i 've have an NE_company-0 for -CONST--0 year and have never have a problem .
i think it cost in the vicinity of $ 50-$ -CONST--0 .
you can get them a bit cheap if you be willing to pump it up yourself .
the semi @-@ automatic that i have do the pump for you .
as i sit here foggy head and let face it with most of the symptom of hypoglycemia i think i should do something about it .
im try to start to eat healthily , slowly but surely , which mean cut out process food and eat more natural thing .
a good start to begin with but not necessarily deal with hypoglycemia .
it say give up thing like caffiene , tobacco , thing i dont consume anyway , it say give up wheat , which be bread , which i tend to eat alot of .
i assume we all do , it kind of house all the other ingredient we need like in sandwich or wrap , pizza .
basically do anybody have any advice on what to eat or recomend a good book ?
search out a glycemia index , and determine something both edible and low on the list .
add that to your diet , to avoid get into hypoglycemia .
if it happen anyway , skim ( non fat ) milk will raise the blood sugar about as fast as anything .
indulge in a light bedtime snack , again , something fairly low on the list .
do n't overdo it , though .
i have not yet be diagnose but i be begin to suspect hypoglycemia @/@ low blood sugar .
lately i have be very confuse , have anxiety , dizziness , fatigue , weak , depress , and generally low .
i know i need to gain more weight - i lose about -CONST--0 pound suddenly about -CONST--1 month ago and have n't be able to gain it back .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do a doctor diagnose someone with this ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 test should i have them run ?
i have be read about NE_vaccine-0 , the new flu vaccine that be administer intranasally .
-CONST--0 thing that i notice , be that it be market as suitable for people age -CONST--1 @-@ -CONST--2 .
i have not see any material as to why the 50+ population be unsuitable for this vaccine .
anybody know why ?
well , accord to that NE_organization-0 link children between -CONST--0 and -CONST--1 be the most likely to actually get the flu itself and it look like that be the intend target age group for the development of NE_product-0 .
they note that it be -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 effective in prevent people in that range from get the flu at all but people in the -CONST--1 @-@ -CONST--2 range only have lessen symptom .
it seem the older the patient the less effective the drug .
it be inconceivable that you take a multivitamin in good faith and it wreck havoc on your health in such a profound way but that be the case .
i " be " take a NE_multivitamin-0 -CONST--0 day as suggest on the back label and -CONST--1 be wake up with dry mouth so sever -CONST--2 could not even swallow .
my skin be get scaly , my eye burn and my feet be so dry they begin to develop callus and crack .
i stop my vitamin and it be now go .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be up NE_product-0 ?
it be not just NE_product-0 but any type of multivitamin cause this .
if you search the internet for " dry mouth and multivitamin " you get this idiot name " NE_idiot-0 " on NE_publication-0 that reply that it be " not likely " that a multivitamin be cause this dryness of nearly every cell in the body .
sorry to say NE_person-0 whoever you be but you be wrong...
if you do n't know what you be talk about you should n't be doling out incorrect information in an online medical forum .
my sister be a nurse at a veteran hospital and she complain to her doctor that she be get dry mouth .
he tell her that it be her multivitamin and she cut down her intake of the multivitamin and her dry mouth left completely .
a friend of mine who take many medication for his heart just come up to me and tell me he be get terrible dry mouth at night and reduce his multivitamin to only a few ENT_temporal-quantity-0 -CONST--0 week and now no more dry mouth .
in other word if you follow the direction on the back label of your vitamin they will start slowly kill you .
do n't expect NE_doctor-0 m.d.to help you either .
he basically dismiss this elderly person claim then try to get her to take corrective medication .
how typical...
i get dry mouth too plus -CONST--0 skin get dry and scaly and when i stop my multivitamin it immediately go away .
now this be -CONST--0 completely unrelated people all come to the exact same conclusion .
not only can we not trust the general consensus on the internet but we cannot trust people who have phd credentials give their advice online .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do we have to dry up and die before we finally figure out what ail us ?
when my sister tell this to me i do not really give it much think .
then i permanently lose -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of my eyesight due to dry eye .
then my mouth chronically become dry , skin keep pile up on my feet that i could n't sand it off fast enough to keep up with it , the skin on my hand become scaly and my lip keep crack and my tongue feel like it have pin and needle poke into it .
i stop the multivitamin and my mouth symptom be go , sadly my eyesight be still damage .
i should have just listen to my sister rather than err , NE_person-0
my doctor be even prescribe fish oil supplement to correct the dry skin problem which could not even put a dent in the problem be cause by my multivitamin .
i do n't consume a lot of salt in my diet and i be on no other medication or drug whatsoever .
if you be experience dry mouth and take a multivitamin stop the vitamin immediately before you ruin your health irreversibly .
take it only a few ENT_temporal-quantity-0 -CONST--0 week , if that , and you will realize the vitamin cause this .
i be also tell by a pharmacist that other than the antioxidants , a person get what they need from their diet of most mineral and do not require a multivitamin at all .
so a strictly antioxidant formula be all that be require minus the multivitamin mineral .
-CONST--0 weigh in on this , sorry i be upset about this but i be also trouble now by internet advice that be clearly wrong about this issue and no tell how many others .
tinnitus , vision loss , global cellular degeneration , moisture loss , and even constipation be all cause by general use of multivitamins .
also if you be feed your children multivitamins you should be highly cautious of this too .
even child should only be give a multivitamin a few ENT_temporal-quantity-0 -CONST--0 week and not every day .
they should be explain the danger of regular use of vitamin ( in other word follow the prescribed dosage ) .
take it from me who have experience this first hand , my sister who be a nurse , my friend take many meds whose dry mouth stop the very day he cut down on his multivitamin and l.f who be incorrectly advise by , err , NE_person-0 .
it be a sad commentary that people have to collectively learn this on their own and that doctor , health specialist and the internet be so out of the loop .
consider that vitamin water and health food drink on top of a multivitamin only compound this problem .
i forget what my sister say be cause this , i seem to recall zinc , but i may be wrong about that .
i have to ask her again .
consider if it be visibly destroy your skin it be also destroy your major organ too .
-CONST--0 comment and offer any further advice on this subject .
i just start on a new kind of multivitamin and my body 's be all kind of crazy .
i use to just take specific vitamin but that get expensive and elaborate and i be miss some thing so i switch to a multi .
the multi have calcium and i know from previous experience that calcium tear my stomach up .
i 'm get older and i know that i need some calcium though .
i do n't have dry mouth but i agree that multivitamins can have unintended consequence .
i have be take high potency multivitamins for almost -CONST--0 year .
i have not know any side effect .
-CONST--0 thing , though be to not have certain food too close to the time of the take , because certain -CONST--1 can interact .
for instance , -CONST--0 be take something now that advise to not take regular vitamin c for -CONST--1 hour on either side of take that product .
it suggest discontinue the -CONST--0 hour release of vitamin c for as long as that product be be use .
i have to constantly make such comparison to make sure it all work .
i be on very high dose vitamin c , besides my NE_product-0 , that be very concentrate compare top wimpy NE_product-1 .
i never have dry mouth until this high dose of c , so i be assume it be the c.
i use it as an antihistamine to control my NE_disease-0 .
i have overactive mast cell that start pull water into my gut when i run out of c and magnesium ( this i think be cause by take a round of vaccine in -CONST--0 , and the study i find online confirm that mercury in the adjuvants often do cause increase histamine production ) .
so -CONST--0 be on -CONST--1 @-@ -CONST--2 mg of c 4x ENT_temporal-quantity-0 and -CONST--3 @-@ -CONST--4 mg magnesium -CONST--5 x ENT_temporal-quantity-1 .
this be a lot , but i have learn it do control my bowel .
the normal person would get colon blow from these dose , and it firm me up to normal .
this be ultimately an adrenal issue , as the adrenals be throw out huge amount of electrolyte and i be sure other stuff , so until i realize this i be in constant loose bowel lose my nutrient .
but it have cause dry mouth .
i do n't think it be as bad as some i have read here .
there be some archaelogists who believe that -CONST--0 site in NE_country-0 could be the world 's early city .
NE_city-0 and NE_city-1 in the ne of NE_country-0 may have exist back in 3700bc .
seem plausible .
NE_city-0 be generally consider to be the oldest continuously inhabit city in the world .
it 's mention by name in NE_book-0 as a place where NE_person-0 stop on his way to NE_world-region-0 from NE_city-0 ( in modern @-@ day NE_country-0 ) .
accord to this , NE_country-0 citizen can now be arrest and detain indefinitely without trial .
do that mean that anyone can be take and put into a hole forever without justification ?
if so , i think it 's scary .
but ENT_amr-unknown-0 decide that the person be actually a member of or work for NE_criminal-organization-0 ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 court can review that decision ?
well , the verdict just come in .
guilty of involuntary manslaughter .
the judge would not let him be release until sentence either .
the judge say his behavior be wreckless and the community could be in harm 's way . ( not his exact word ) .
i be glad he be lose his license .
no matter ENT_amr-unknown-0 , he never should have give NE_person-0 that propofol .
the man practiced here for many year .
the local tv news be run nothing but outrage over the conviction .
not -CONST--0 word in favor of it .
the local NE_channel-0 feature a legal expert who deride the trial , call it a travesty , make doctor afraid to treat patient and so forth .
he seem to think a " proper " court would have let NE_person-0 go free .
an increase proportion of NE_country-0 children be so severely obese as to be at immediate risk for life @-@ threaten complication include NE_disease-0 .
some will become candidate for treatment at newly establish pediatric surgical weight loss programs throughout the country .
as an alternative approach , involvement of state protective service might be consider , include placement into foster care in carefully select situation .
ultimately , ENT_government-organization-0 can reduce the need for such intervention through investment in the social infrastructure and policy to improve diet and promote physical activity among children .
severe obesity in children -- be that a form of child abuse ?
should the state step in and save these kid from their parent ?
david... NE_person-0 're so not look at the big picture .
if this current trend continue , a whole generation or -CONST--0 will be lose .
consider that we be globally compete against NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 who so far do n't suffer this epidemic , we will fall farther behind in almost every aspect .
these next generation will become a major burden on our health care system .
prevention be need now not later when it will much likely not work .
cheap to fix it now then to let it cripple the entire economy at a later date .
i live in NE_state-0 and i sign an affiliation agreement 12 @/@ -CONST--0 which state that i be to pay a ENT_temporal-quantity-0 fee to the owner .
the owner say " not " to pay until my business have pick up .
although my business be struggle , i have try several time to start pay this fee .
each time the owner say " no " do n't worry about .
we have now part way , for both personal and professional reason , and now they be take me to small claim court for the affiliation fee they say i do n't have to pay plus their legal fee ( i be be bully ) .
have anyone dealt with a situation like this ?
i think a verbal agreement would override a write agreement , but be that hard to prove ?
i mean obviously the proof be that they be sue me for back fee that i have not be pay because business have be slow .
-CONST--0 , help or share your story .
it sound like there be more than what you have post .
did you break a lease or agreement with them ?
leave early ?
it sound like they be waive certain fee , with the understand that you be go to stay for the long haul .
if you leave early , then they now want all their fee .
a write agreement trump a verbal agreement .
a write agreement be hard proof .
without that it 's your word against their word .
you should have put the money be escrow if you feel uncomfortable with the arrangement .
my newspaper have an article today on animal hoarder , list some signifigant recent case :
-CONST--0 woman live on an old school bus with -CONST--1 dog , -CONST--2 cat and -CONST--3 chicken .
-CONST--0 man have -CONST--1 dog .
another have -CONST--0 cat .
-CONST--0 week ago , animal service confiscate -CONST--1 cat live with a man in a van .
most hoarder live in unimaginable filth .
( i do n't want to post the photo because they be really gross.)
most of these people be charge with animal abuse and neglect and they be fine and jail .
do you think these people be criminal ?
i watch NE_publication-0 ( way too late at night this weekend ) and see a NE_broadcast-program-0 .
they bust a hoarder with -CONST--0 dog and confiscate -CONST--1 of them ( i think legally in fla you can have 4 ) .
the dog be in such bad shape , some could n't walk because their nail be so long , most be flea infest and have be sleep in their own feces .
there be -CONST--0 set of puppy in the house and as they pan around the house , it appear that there be at least -CONST--1 other set of puppy in the make .
the woman be not prosecute as long as she be willing to give up the amount need to take her back to the legal limit .
and they check up on her after that .
apparently the media run a story about it and over -CONST--0 dog be adopt the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 day they be available .
i go for mentally ill as well , but like NE_person-0 say , sometimes the only way to get them treatment be to prosecute .
they just tell this woman they would keep check up on her ( randomly so she could n't hide pet like she be when they be round them up ) and as long as she have only 4 , she be fine .
that seem reasonable to me since no dog be dead , no dog be starve , they just need more attention .
it be a much better story than the dog chain to a tree for -CONST--0 week in NE_state-0 heat that finally succumbed...made me cry .
now those people should be tie to a tree with no food and water and see how they do...
we have our own local " cat lady " who make the newspaper headline a couple of decade ago .
she live in a filthy , almost uninhabitable house surround by cat , cat , cat .
many people try to help her , but she make it impossible for anyone to give her effective assistance even in the face of have her home condemn .
and that 's what eventually happen .
her house be declare a public nuisance and the city tore it down .
i 'm pretty sure this old lady have more than just a few screw loose .
-CONST--0 see her many year ago at a local supermarket .
she be wear a drab winter coat and a large colorful scarf around her head with her unkempt gray wig hair stick out .
she be slump against a wall and the store personnel have call an ambulance .
it be a pathetic sight .
i think it be a kind of depression myself , where one let go of a lot of effort to keep up with ENT_temporal-quantity-0 life except to ' care ' for animal , and then be overwhelm but see no way out of it - except that they do , i gather , start again .
a kind of compulsion .
not that i do n't want them stop .
be this a kind of ocd ? a pre @-@ alzheimers ?
there be something to be say for humane institutional care , and i be not talk about the dog .
tricky subject , on which i can see several side .
please - this be not a thread about the case , as such , i find those thread concern - but about some of the difference between the NE_country-0 , and some other country ' practice - and their effect .
for instance : i ) in NE_country-0 , and , i NE_country-1 at the very least , the name of a juvenile involve in a criminal matter be not reveal , whether they be allege victim , or allege perpetrator , except in very special circumstance
( eg they have be kidnap , and police seek public help to find them - or they have be murder - or if they be allege to have commit a very serious crime and be be try as adult , or if it be in some way in the public interest.)
to these non @-@ NE_country-0 eye , it be very shock to see the name and photograph of the young man allege to have be abuse by NE_person-0 splash all over the media -
here , juvenile be protect to the point that , on the few occasion i have accompany a minor who be rape or sexually abuse to court , while she @/@ he give testimony - if the offender ( these be case where , oddly , a conviction be obtain , so i do not say " allege " offender ) be also a minor , it be a big deal to be allow in to be a support person for the victim , because i would hear the name of the -CONST--0 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do people think of the NE_country-0 practice ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the reason for it ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would you prefer ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think be the impact on young people so identified ?
ii ) the media circus .
here , both defence and prosecution be very limit as to what they can say about a case that be before the court . the matter be consider sub judice .
occasionally , with high profile case , the police will " leak " thing - and @/@ or the media will attempt , within the letter of the law , to try a case in the media ( the NE_person-0 case be a terrible example of both these occurrence ) -
but the organised propaganda campaign that i think i detect in the NE_country-0 be not generally present .
full detail be generally releasable only after the trial .
again , the spectacle be very shock to these non @-@ NE_country-0 eye .
i presume it be allow because of an interpretation of free speech ?
do people think it aid justice ? that it be societally positive ? ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think ?
iii ) this be unrelated - but , do people think this be go to be another black v white case , and do you think that high profile non @-@ NE_ethnic-group-0 people still - despite their wealth and power - be unfairly treat in the NE_country-0 justice system ?
i would think that , similarly to here , that poor and obscure people of colour would tend to be - but i be interested in view re people who have achievedfame and fortune .
judge the NE_country-0 legal system based on what go on in , say , the NE_person-0 case be probably a bad idea .
i 've serve on jury duty several time and come away highly impress with how seriously everybody take their various responsibility .
a case like NE_person-0 's , alas , or the NE_person-1 case betray many standard .
the media have some role in this , as do glory @-@ hound attorney on both side .
i 'm sure , for example , that a minor 's name should never be publicize in a case like this .
i 'm try to pay as little attention to this case as possible , because i think it 's more a freak show than anything else .
-CONST--0 do n't judge our system on the basis of the NE_person-0 trial !
we have very strict publication ban around identity of abuse minor in NE_country-0 .
the person charge often cannot be identify , as their name , and the detail of the relationship to the child , would mean the child could possibly be identify .
sleep next to the elephant mean we 've probably become a bit jaded to the circus . but the law be much tighter here .
i would be extraordinarily happy not to make such a judgment , NE_person-0 ! !!! but - it be allow to happen !
would the name of the child , for instance , normally be suppress ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 often do case become media circus ?
i guess what i be get at be the different law on such matters...
interest to have such difference in the system of country that grew so similarly , NE_person-0 .
we seem much more like you guy - but , -CONST--0 suppose , the NE_country-0 invent its law after a revolution - we inherit them after century of slow evolution with no cataclysm , and make change slowly .
i think but i 'm not completely sure if you can print any name of a sexual abuse victim in NE_country-0 without the express permission of the victim .
you cannot print the name of any minor whether the victim or perpetrator of any crime , except in very special @/@ rare circumstance where a minor be at large and a suspected danger to the community or themselves .
a court order be need in these case and once the minor be apprehend the name and or picture must not be print again , ever .
news outlet be rarely allow to print anything specific in these case as well .
in case of family abuse the name be rarely print , if ever , in order to protect the victim .
i have no idea the victim in the NE_person-0 case be publicize .
i have see picture of his previous victim which i though be pretty appal but generally the face have be smudge out .
what i hope will happen here be that people will come along to present the case for allow the name to be make public , because it be incomprehensible to me -
but there must be reason for the NE_country-0 system to be the way it be on these matter .
it be n't as though people in the NE_country-0 be not interested in and critical of their own system - gotta be a reason...
i think they be get ready to bring the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 miner up .
over -CONST--0 feet up , in a little tube , through a little tunnel .
on NE_publication-0 i see a picture -CONST--0 show of the face of the miner , and i see at least a couple guy that look way too big to fit in that thing .
i guess they 'll be suck in their gut .
wow , -CONST--0 day .
that 's like a full season of NE_broadcast-program-0 .
i guess the whole rescue be suppose to take about -CONST--0 day , if their estimate be correct and nothing go wrong .
and the whole thing will be watch live all over the world .
here 's a place where there be some livestreams if you want to check it out .
NE_country-0 could learn a lot from the NE_country-1 people as the -CONST--0 miner be rescue .
they come together to support and save the miner ' life .
so much better than the political party fight go on over the come election in the NE_country-0
i have a question .
the last man , one of the rescuer , must be able to lock the rescue tube 's door correctly from the inside ?
i can understand how he could hook up the oxygen pack and other devise , but i can n't figure out how he can lock the door so it do n't come loose if no one be there to do it from the outside .
he will have to hold it shut with a handle or maybe a bungee cord hold on the inside .
good question .
look like these guy be gonna get out in time to do their NE_festival-0 shop
i be sorry ; but i think chili be part of america...
-CONST--0 of them at least...
they come in -CONST--0 's you know...inner NE_province-0 , and NE_province-1 mongolia...that sort of thing...
in any event , i do not know the answer to your question...
it would seem that for most door , there be a handle on the inside and the outside...
just like hammer have claw so you can go both way with a nail...
speak from experience , it be damn difficult some time not have reverse on a motor cycle...
you can n't stop ride without think about ride later...
here i be , and ENT_amr-unknown-0 do i get out..
i 'm watch on the telly yet another shooter ( NE_city-0 fla ) news say -CONST--0 victim take to hospital .
you know what NE_person-0 be go to tell you in a few minute : if the others have gun to protect themselves , they all would be dead by now .
that 's how gun logic work , my dear dys .
guess all the gun crazy psychotic be flip out of the woodwork .
yeah , and then i 'm a gun owner .
and your """" enlighten """" solution be ?
my " enlighten " solution be for everyone to determine who might become a potential shooter and kill them before they be able to harm anyone .
do my sarcasm equate adequately to yours ?
i 'm talk specifically about the show of the content of the package that he send to NE_publication-0 .
i realize that this stuff will probably come out anyway , and that the public really really want to see ENT_amr-unknown-0 be in that package , but be n't it also in a way glorify @/@ validate the guy 's action and give him exactly what he want ?
for instance , the image of him point a gun at the camera be on just about every news site i see online , and the video clip of his rantings be start to show up everywhere as well . and his write .
i realize how fascinate it be to try to get inside this nutball 's head , but be there any way to put the news out there about him without give him rock star status ?
be it even possible ?
i wonder how long until this stuff show up on -CONST--0 or -CONST--1 of those other disgust site .
i think there can be detail ( ENT_amr-unknown-0 happen ENT_amr-unknown-1 , ENT_amr-unknown-2 try to do ENT_amr-unknown-3 , etc.) without spread his own propaganda . because that 's ENT_amr-unknown-4 it be .
he stage @-@ manage this -- he want the badass stuff out there , he want that last image .
just show a small picture of who he be , the original one be fine .
the rest be unnecessary , and article NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 have link to argue convincingly that the propaganda be downright dangerous .
the NE_country-0 public have reach the point in our culture , that the news that get the most coverage be the news that play to the lowest common denominator amongst us .
think about it . for week , there be NE_person-0 and the baby . then it be NE_person-1 . now all we hear about be that murderous nutjob who act on his sick delusion .
it be like the newspaper and tv want to beat out the supermarket rag . ugh !
i 've be enjoy the NE_newspaper-0 blog , primarily by NE_person-0 , who i 'm use to read when he write about art.
but he 's join by several other good writer who be apparently hang around the NE_game-0 type away as they feel like it .
i like all the different viewpoint .
have always like NE_person-0 's write , but can n't read him in the paper lately because he 's now in the NE_newspaper-0 select group that you have to pay for to get access to , even on the day of the article .
my favorite writer on the blog be NE_person-0 , he seem to have my eye , if i have his .
i 'm enjoy the play by play , as it be , so much that i want to see if i can go back and read the blog on the NE_game-0 .
probably not , as so much time have pass .
anybody on NE_publication-0 follow this ?
go to the match ?
i do follow international tennis -- -CONST--0 of the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 thing i want to glance over on the morning newspaper .
not go to the match , though ?
well , so be you follow the NE_game-0 ( -CONST--0 : //www.usopen.org/)?
who be your fave player ?
yeah , she sure be a tennis prodigy .
she 's always lack the killer serve that be a key to today 's power game , though .
if she do n't have it in her heyday , she 's not go to have it now in the twilight of her career .
hey , hope your day be go well !
i have a question for anyone who feel that want to answer .
i have be watch a bit of ' rhythmic gymnastics ' on youtube...i just find it amazing...it 's very cool .
i do n't have child , but when i get to that stage , i 'd love a daughter of mine to take part in this really cool sport .
my question though be , be it true or just a myth that while all this crazy flexibility at a young age be nice , at old age they will be in pain and not able to move at all ?
if it be true , i 'd prefer not to have any part in it , but if it 's not true , it would be great to know .
can anyone help ?
i 'm no expert , but NE_gymnast-0 comenechi , the famous NE_country-0 gymnast , have no health problem from her gymnastics day though her former gymnast husband be wracked with arthritis .
thank for you quick reply .
could it be that different people react to it in different way ?
maybe you just enjoy it while you do , and if you find it painful afterwards...bad luck , if not...great !
have anyone else get any other thought ?
i 'm not familiar with rhythmic gymnastics , but i know both gymnast and dancer be prone to on @-@ the @-@ job injury -- and the effect of those injury can add up .
the behaviour of NE_country-0 cricket fan be of more concern than the -CONST--0 of spirit NE_organization-0 member set to descend upon our shore for this summer 's NE_series-0 , say NE_state-0 's police .
the number of NE_country-0 fan travel to NE_country-1 be expect to easily surpass the 10,000 who come for the -CONST--0 @-@ 03 NE_series-0 because of last year 's victory and because of an online ticket fiasco that saw -CONST--1 of NE_country-2 fan nab NE_series-1 ticket mean for australians .
there have be some discussion here about the NE_game-0 .
not the test series , the actual one .
apparently the aussies ( a devious lot ) have say that when they win the series ( that 's if they do , but they do n't think that way ) they want to take the small urn from its permanent place at NE_sports-facility-0 back to oz .
NE_club-0 say , on your bike cobber , because that urn be a gift , not a trophy , and it stay where it be .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 say the aussies now ?
i 'm sit here pull my hair out because my roomate be watch the NE_game-0 on tv . i 'd rather drink battery acid than watch golf .
while semi @-@ watch , i just realize something : while the golfer be set up his shot , and about to swing , all the fan get very quiet for them . then i think about fan at sport games( golf be n't a sport event , it 's a hobby ) , and they scream , yell , and do their best to annoy the oppose team 's player and throw them off their game .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 the hell do golfer escape that aspect ? the pressure and ability to block stuff out add to the challenge . ENT_amr-unknown-1 be they so special ?
this make me just hate watch golf on tv even more .
i love golf .
do n't understand watch it .
also do n't understand course that use cart .
none of that new @-@ fangled crap for me .
walk , and carry your bloody club .
so there be others out there other than myself that hate golf and believe its not a sport ? thats wonderful !
golf be a sport... an incredibly bore sport...
tennis player get the same ' silent treatment ' from spectator -- not exactly sure why...
bite me , NE_person-0 .
hatred of golf be for people with brain deficiency .
-CONST--0 other thing that must annoy you . in all other sport ( yeah , golf be a sport ) ...there be ref and umps and -CONST--1 that . and the people play the sport argue with those official all the time .
in golf...you gotta call foul on yourself . and golfer do !
there ain't nothing in the world better than golf . ( well...maybe -CONST--0 thing . but even that , you can eventually get enough of . you can never get enough of golf.)
will NE_person-0 ever return to the NE_team-0 ?
ever ? yeah , next season .
it 's look like he be out for the year , though depedning on his rehabilitation , he may try to be available for the playoffs .
it 's tough to say though .
my money be on NE_person-0 to return next year .
i do n't think he 's willing to let the previous season 's NE_game-0 be his last .
or it be possible you will stand there with a freeze grin on your face , unable to say anything remotely intelligent .
we can help you !
several of us a2k'ers have create a support group to painlessly guide you towards appear knowledgeable even if , like many of us , you be clueless .
they be call the wildcard game .
you will need to invest a grand total of -CONST--0 minute . total . max .
-CONST--0 indicate , by noon on saturday , jan -CONST--1 th , your pick on these -CONST--2 game :
NE_team-0 @ NE_team-1
NE_team-0 @ NE_team-1
NE_team-0 @ NE_team-1
NE_team-0 @ NE_team-1
NE_team-0 aggravate me no end in NE_game-0 ( NE_person-0 be my quarterback ) , so this seem to me a perfectly good reason to pick NE_team-1 , who also aggravate me , but not as much .
i 'm place my faith that the jet 's defense will kick in one more time .
plus i like it that no one else seem to have faith in NE_team-0 .
besides this wild card round be just fodder for the real game when the NE_team-0 start play and ultimately take the whole burrito , ( enchiladas be n't classy enough for NE_person-0 and the gang ) .
instead of a coin toss - and because i know absolutely nothing about football @- i 'm go to do it by which city i know @/@ like better and see how well i do .
so my pick will be :
NE_city-0
NE_city-0
NE_city-0
NE_city-0
just as an experiment to begin with , but -CONST--0 be fairly competititive in spirit , so if -CONST--1 of my team make NE_game-0 - -CONST--2 'll watch it instead of the NE_broadcast-program-0 marathon and eat me some chicken wing and drink a beer or -CONST--3 .
sound fun to me...can't hurt .
be there a prize ?
in an article in NE_city-0 's " NE_newspaper-0 , NE_person-0 , a NE_award-0 laureate and member of the NE_organization-0 at the NE_university-0 NE_city-1 , recommend that NE_country-0 farmer be allowed( you might even say " be encourage ") to grow poppy ( opium ) legally .
he argue that there be a shortage of painkilling medication , particularly in poor , ENT_ordinal-entity-0 world country , and that NE_country-0 could supply the need poppy at a lower price than commercially produce painkiller .
i see the interview he give on NE_publication-0 recently and he seem to know what he be talk about .
as he put it : " the afghan farmer have to make a live to fee his - often large - family .
we can force him to produce the poppy illegally and fee into the illegal drug market or we can buy the poppy from him and help provide pain @-@ kill drug ."
as i post sometime ago , country such as :france , NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 be permit to grow poppy legally for the production of drug - ENT_amr-unknown-0 not allow the afghan farmer the same privilege ?
have a look at the article and see if you agree with him or not .
the problem with poppy cultivation be n't the grow of the crop itself .
the problem be oversight and market .
opiate have legitimate medicinal use .
unfortunately , the product of the papver NE_plant-0 have far more monetary value on the black market than when sell to legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturer .
thank for the article and the background - i read both .
there would be problem though .
the criminal element that currently buy the crop be still go to try and get their hand on it , so the crop would need to be guard .
that 's go to cost a fair bit and probably result in bloodshed .
hot world conflict in the computer near you ! live ! entertain ! wild !
the future of the news reality show , or whatever should one call it .
NE_person-0 tour the world 's conflict zone with digital technology that will allow him to blog and transmit image and video from war ridden area ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
one can contact him there , or chat with him live on the website .
now while i know he 's do it voluntarily and probably for a shootload of money , i have to say i find the idea of such a project odd and somewhat disconcerning .
will it start a new wave of journalist seek out the most dangerous situation to sell their goods ?
competition on who can go the farthest ?
and will that encourage the side in conflict to up their performance , so to speak , get international live coverage straight from the front ?
especially if there will be more and more NE_person-0 sites'es roam the world ?
-CONST--0 of journalist already do seek out war zone , sure .
but this be take it to a whole new level , i think .
anyway , i 'm confuse about how i feel about it .
i will surely look in often to see where he 's at and will be curious about the report and live video .
it have a voyeuristic element to it , do n't it ?
ah , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be this world come to .
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 do the future of journalism hold for us ?
can we control it in any way ?
what do you think ?
gus , that 's what 's make me uncomfortable .
it just seem like a stoopid idea to me .
but i won't deny that i be also curious , although it make me feel kinda dirty .
partake in make a violent conflict a part of entertainment culture .
well , more so than it already be . yecchh .
everything in life have a positive , and a negative side .
the good thing about this be that they might be able to record what really be happen in certain area of the world in case the ENT_government-organization-0 of the world tell us different .
if they make money good for them !
if they survive many of these men come back home change , and sometimes not for the better .
they could also come back wound or sick .
to me , it 's a good thing to be able to choose how your go to die when it 's for a good cause .
there be incident where the bastard in charge decide it would be best for a certain reporter to " die in conflict "
NE_person-0 better tread carefully .
of course , i imagine he 'll have quite an entourage and that might ensure his safety from the more devious sort .
the NE_organization-0 or at least some of the member threaten sanction .
sanction , ENT_amr-unknown-0 sanction could the NE_organization-0 impose , refuse to purchase the lifeblood of industry " oil "?
NE_country-0 could on the other hand cut their production and cause the price of that commodity to go through the roof .
be the threat of sanction just another instance where the NE_country-0 and the NE_organization-0 be just blow smoke ?
it 's blow smoke as it 's the people who will end up suffer from any such move .
if the NE_organization-0 really want to make a difference , they could threaten to pass a resolution ! !!!!
ooooooh ! that ought to scare ' em...."
and NE_person-0 be clamering the loudest .
do he , i wonder , think that would be his excuse to invade .
it would be wmd 's all over again .
i can n't believe that even the crew that " own " the NE_country-0 at the present time would do something as rash and ill conceive .
let me start by say that i love NE_country-0 .
i 've be there a few ENT_temporal-quantity-0 in the last -CONST--0 or -CONST--1 year and have become familiar with its people and custom and geography and unique challenge .
each time i 've visit , i 've notice immense , fast @-@ pace progress , both economically and socially .
since my ENT_ordinal-entity-0 visit there a network of well @-@ build highway have be build , enable european and internal tourism and commerce to flourish .
i 've witness cell phone come on the market and virtually explode .
high speed internet be available .
house build and land development be through the roof .
agricultural technology have take off and enable farmer to be profitable and efficient , as well as increase the availability of affordable food to all NE_country-0 .
my aim for this thread be to periodically discuss new development and economic initiative in NE_country-0 as they come about in the news , as well as any other news that be deem curious or interesting .
i 'm interested in NE_country-0 .
i know there be some cell there of folk who want to cause havoc but that be presumably not the whole population .
the country have seem attractive to me for ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
at the least , i be interested in hear more about it .
NE_person-0 , -CONST--0 you be more specific about why NE_country-0 be to be avoid ?
this all remind me of myself sit at a train station in NE_country-0 at about -CONST--0 @:@ -CONST--1 a.m . -CONST--2 morning .
my husband and i wander in after buy our train ticket to get cappuccini and dolci before the ride... and share a table with -CONST--0 tourist from the NE_country-0 .
on my right be a table of ENT_amr-unknown-0 turn out to be moroccan laborers .
-CONST--0 xhub and the tourers be talk away about something and i glance over at the ( moroccans ) and we start talk in poor NE_language-0 , which be how i find out they be from NE_country-0 .
very polite sleepy early morning nice conversation.. i turn to the others and the lady say , " dear , you musn't talk with them , they be dangerous ."
i can n't remember ENT_amr-unknown-0 i say , but ENT_amr-unknown-1 be short , succinct .
that be a long time ago .
not every immigrant from far away land be the devil in disguise , and neither be all of us .
well say , NE_person-0 !
-CONST--0 have n't be there myself but my -CONST--1 son and a friend went a couple of year ago .
they say a ) it be one of the most beautiful place they have be and b ) it be the place in the world they have be most hassle and cheat .
i think , too , that as -CONST--0 young men travel together , they be look upon as a challenge by local youth .
they say there be fight amongst kid in the street and this seem to be normal and tolerate .
so it be a society with a very male testosterone @-@ rich style .
the shop run by women be altogether less hassly , more friendly .
-CONST--0 thing they find particularly hard to deal with be other young men attach themselves to their group and be undislodgeable ( a nwe word and it 's only -CONST--1 am ! ) .
my eldest who be especially friendly and tolerant try to make friend with these people but in the end they all want something .
that can be dispirit for the open @-@ mind and open @-@ hearted .
but they enjoy their stay generally , would certainly not avoid it in future .
as for lump all NE_religious-group-0 country together as a no go area - what complete nonsense !
as we 're go to NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 at the end of this month , and expect to have a wonderful trip as independent traveller , i be definitely make a political statement -
i do not lump all muslims together , and believe that -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 be friendly to traveller .
most be undoubtedly anti @-@ NE_country-0 and anti @-@ NE_person-0 , but that be not a sentiment confine to the islamists .
my engagement ring @/@ wed ring and other personal ring along with my husband 's wed ring be steal .
at least we assume so .
we go camp and put them together in the car .
after camp and come home we search high and low and could not find them .
we call the campground and the owner say they have clean our campsite and do not find anything .
so we have to assume some one stole them .
we do have the car unlock at time so it be a definate possibility .
really stink at it be just our anniversary right before .
yep , that stink .
we be rob -CONST--0 time right before NE_festival-0 .
came home , and the basement door have be kick in .
all they take be wrap NE_festival-0 gift , and all of my husband 's sock .
sound funny now , but at the time i feel very violate at the thought of stranger go through my house .
@mags314772,
yes i can say the -CONST--0 thing be at least it be n't in my house .
the idea of some one go through your house be as bad as them take NE_festival-0 present .
wow , the afghanis be in for a life @-@ change shock to their culture and way of life .
tribal leader , international corporation , international ENT_government-organization-0 and border neighbors will all be vie with each other and the NE_country-0 people for a piece of the action .
it will be interesting to watch who take what side .
will NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 now side with the NE_criminal-organization-0 to take over the country and exploit the riches ?
will the NE_country-0 help the NE_country-1 people to learn from our mistake and protect -CONST--0 natural environment from strip mine ?
will NE_criminal-organization-0 queda now return to the country to enrich themselves with the profit ?
will the lithium deposit take away from effort by NE_person-0 and others to invest in and invent research and development in improve battery storage for the very young renewable clean energy industry in the u.s ?
i dont think that any vast deposit find in one land that barely exist as a state and have almost no industry will be a setup for a despotic regime or a surge of NE_criminal-organization-0 takeover of province within which be these deposit .
since much of it lie in the mountainous region of the west and southwest , these be already the subject of the new campaign against a resurface NE_criminal-organization-0 .
these mineral , especially the lithium , will need major process before its in a commercial state for battery .
long term development for all kind of battery for entire new gizmos ( not just NE_product-0 ) will be based on better and better lithium cell .
most of the world recoverable deposit lie in NE_continent-0 lake deposit and in our own NE_local-region-0 in vast quartz deposit .
if they find deposit of rhodium and platinum itd be a major reason to enter negotiation to help em develop -CONST--0 resource .
you can have all the rear metal in the world in your country , but the support infrastructer 's must be in place , i.e. road , power plant , process facilties , water , ton and ton of water , chemical supplier , etc.
so what may appear as a rich mineral bonanza , will be shoot down for now and the forseable future , because the cost of extraction , be larger that any profit margin .
the administrative and legislative branch of -CONST--0 ENT_government-organization-0 can n't agree on how to make a dent in our deficit .
the solution ?
go on vacation for -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 and appoint a bipartisan group of senator and representative to try to work out some sort of plan .
their mission be to reduce next year 's deficit by $ 1.2tn over the next -CONST--0 year .
they must come up with a plan by NE_festival-0 - roughly -CONST--0 day - that -CONST--1 of the -CONST--2 member can agree on .
if they fail , there will be across the board cut .
if they succeed , their plan must pass the NE_government-organization-0 and the NE_government-organization-1 with no alteration .
i , too , be skeptical , NE_person-0 .
the -CONST--0 dems and -CONST--1 repubs from the NE_government-organization-0 seem to be intractably commit to their NE_political-party-0 ' more extreme wing .
the senator be be describe as " dealmakers , " willing to compromise at the end .
we will have to see .
in the meantime , if any of you find biography of the -CONST--0 member of the super committee , -CONST--1 link or write your own profile of them .
i 've say elsewhere that i do n't think they 're expect to accomplish anything .
they may put out a proposal but it will probably fail in one chamber or the other .
neither chamber can come to consensus on substantive reform , imo , and the trigger will be pull .
the trigger be specifically choose because each one be desirable to one party and not anethema to the other .
it never be a good idea and only seem to be a good idea to the moron .
there be never any reason to think that this be go to work , and now that it will not they be go to try to defuse the trigger...but that might not work either .
i dont know what the NE_city-0 odds of gut the NE_government-organization-0 be but i put it at around -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 .
it be always go to happen at some point , but maybe -CONST--0 @-@ -CONST--1 year down the line , not now .
if this happen it will be a major break of faith with the NE_country-0 people .
-CONST--0 of americans go to war for NE_country-0 , and come back break or otherwise give up a lot , and now we look to take a huge chunk of their hide because NE_government-organization-0 no long work .
this , folk , be go to be a problem .
edit : " delay and pray " have not work in NE_continent-0 , and it will not work in NE_continent-1 .
in both place we see from our so call leader a massive refusal to step up to the plate .
bullshit ! !! we be our own people .
the reason we be fight the world war be because the very rich who dont want to pay their share of tax want the protection of the ENT_government-organization-0 for the wealth and job they have import to other country .
what the majority of the u.s citizen get in return be nothing but a lack of job and a reduction in our ability to fee our family .
time to plug yourself in for a recharge , youre start to run down .
if you wanna defeat NE_person-0 , seem to me you need a candidate with something between their ear .
all i see be bozo and friend on the NE_political-party-0 side .
( hint : id vote for a NE_political-party-0 if one of substance show up , im not too thrill with the job NE_person-0 do .
i think he waste his capital on the health care right at the begin of the worst economic situation weve see in our lifetime .
unfortunately , you cannot really think that any of the present gaggle of NE_political-party-0 candidate have get substance ) .
thus the analysis that i have put up on NE_publication-0 in multiple place that the NE_country-0 federal ENT_government-organization-0 be corrupt , and be run by the corporate class .
we see the oppression of the people by the ENT_government-organization-0 in other area besides economics though , for instance i have point out how this oppression be weave onto our sex law .
the oppressor should not get too comfy , as oppressor the world over be find out they get over thrown by force of public will .
the oppressor of the NE_country-0 people will eventually suffer the same fate...
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be NE_person-0 when we need him --- again ?
the greatest irony i 've see here at NE_publication-0 NE_person-0 be although i agree with on the statement that the NE_country-0 be an oligarchy or a plutocracy i believe you have foolishly drunk the NE_product-0 to think the NE_political-party-0 be genuine in it 's pursuit to save the country from " our oppressor " when every move they propose be a basic tenet to strengthen the status quo .
clearly you be too blind by your personal selfishness and greed to see and feel the rain fall on your head from your NE_political-party-0 overlord .
ENT_government-organization-0 exist for a reason .
progressive ENT_government-organization-0 exist and should continue to exist in order to protect it 's citizen from the raid and loot horde of the multibillion dollar conglomerate and bank institution who themselves exist in order to set up a select small population into extreme wealth and power .
i be not of the NE_political-party-0 , i be a radical leftist formerly a revolutionary currently a socialist .
it could be argue that a better word be collectivist...
i strongly support libertarian political action because i want to see individual once again free enough from ENT_government-organization-0 oppresion that they can choose to come together in collective effort .
what we have now be a sham socialism impossed by a ENT_government-organization-0 which be own by the coporate class , whos only mission be to grab more wealth .
we be free from ENT_government-organization-0 oppression .
now if we can free ourselves from our -CONST--0 dollar overlord perhaps we can enjoy real freedom and get rid of our bought politician .
the euro country be afraid to let NE_country-0 go bankrupt , because it will be follow by NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 .
if that happen , the euro 's value will drop to unimaginable level , and inflation will hit all their country .
the NE_government-organization-0 euro policy continue to exacerbate the problem for NE_country-0 and the other euro country with huge deficit .
NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 be try their best to prop up NE_country-2 with more loan and forgive of loan , but that seem like a lose proposition when NE_country-3 really do n't have an economy that can pay back the loan they already have .
it seem like desperation time for the euro zone country , but the majority be in no position to assist NE_country-0 with their grow deficit .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 long will this plug of hole in the dam last ?
NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 be in no position to save all of them when the water 's rush get stronger by the month ( grow deficit ) .
NE_country-0 's debt be -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of gdp .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 will they survive ?
i believe we 're on the rim of an economic maelstrom .
NE_country-0 be only the latest symptom of a financial disease that have become pandemic .
i believe that , too .
rather like an individual who work hard , produce useful work , and save for the future suddenly find himself wipe out because of the act of a central bank , somewhere .
you guy be depress me .
can n't i just go back to blissful ignorance ?
after wwii , the recovery be fast .
there be pent up demand for everything after the war , because most civilian earn money build our war machine for -CONST--0 year , and there be hardly any consumer goods to buy .
even food be put on ration .
what be " funny " to some degree be the " cheap " junk we import from NE_country-0 , because NE_country-1 be ready to spend money .
i remember lighter from NE_country-0 be make from soda pop can , and they must have sell -CONST--0 of those .
it appear a global recession be on its way .
a bush league president and political party should never be near the steer wheel of the NE_country-0 economy .
their reckless policy and ideology can only lead backwards to a -CONST--0 th or -CONST--1 th century society of robber baron and ideological cutthroat .
it 's too late ; we 've be a recession many month ago ; most family could not continue to live their lifestyles of a couple of year ago because food and fuel cost have increase to the point most could not keep up with those higher cost .
as family member lose their job and home , many also lose their health insurance .
that 's a biggie for most family .
you can listen to our ENT_government-organization-0 about " not be in a recession , " but i see it different .
some important cricket be go to be play out in the next coupla month :
NE_country-0 take on NE_country-1 ( or rather australian spectator take on NE_person-0 ) ; NE_country-2 sweat it out with NE_country-3 ; NE_country-4 prepare to face NE_country-5 .
there 's lot to talk about .
would the ozzies and indians ( NE_country-0 be allow , too ) want to talk over a beer or -CONST--0 ?
i 'm here !
glad they give NE_person-0 a run .
the NE_festival-0 test in NE_city-0 be aus vs NE_country-0 .
i go to the last aus @-@ NE_country-0 test .
we arrive , and the scoreboard read NE_country-0 -CONST--0 @-@ 705. aarrggghhh !
i take a photo of it .
was still a draw , though . NE_person-0 's last NE_city-0 test .
hope that do n't happen again !
australian rock NE_legend-0 have die this morning after suffer a major heart attack overnight .
NE_person-0 , -CONST--0 , die in the early hour of the morning after he be rush to NE_city-0 NE_hospital-0 at -CONST--1 am ( -CONST--2 ) , a spokesman have say .
did he do anything a non @-@ aussie may recognise ?
NE_person-0 move to the NE_country-0 in -CONST--0 .
NE_music-0 be release in -CONST--0 NE_broadcast-program-0 .
NE_person-0 headline his own sold out tour through -CONST--0 and 80 .
sometime there abouts his record lable went belly up .
NE_company-0 assume the right .
live as fast as he die .
at least in the early year .
they should have a -CONST--0 minute silence up at NE_worship-place-0 .
after strategically ' excise ' bit of NE_country-0 in order to thwart people smuggler ( you can n't land in NE_country-1 if we pass a law to say it be n't NE_country-2 this week ) , our pint @-@ size pm have decide to think big .
how big .
real big .
the govt be plan to create a ' security zone ' that extend -CONST--0 nautical mile around the country .
this would allow the monitor and possible interception of any vessel within the zone .
amazingly , other nearby nation ( NE_country-0 for one ) be a bit put out as it extend NE_country-1 soverienty well into sth NE_world-region-0 .
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
the NE_country-0 have one....
there must be some sort of international bench @-@ mark for piss off other nation in play here .
this govt have also repeatadly say that ENT_government-organization-0 will take independent action to pre @-@ emptively strike at ' terror ' and we be sourcing supplier of cruise missile .
now , it be pretty obvious that NE_country-0 won't be attack from the east ( NE_country-1 ) , the south ( NE_continent-0 ) or the west ( big ocean then NE_country-2 ) .
so , ' security zone ' be shorthand for , ' you sneaky little brown people better not try any funny business '.
of course they just happen to be the most populous muslim nation on earth - of course we should always walk tall and talk tough when deal with them .
could you imagine ENT_amr-unknown-0 tough NE_government-organization-0 would be if there be the ' NE_country-0 ' with a billion or more people sit on their northern border ?
you will never ever appease NE_country-0 .
they could n't give a stuff about NE_country-0 no matter what we say .
they would have invade us long ago if there be n't a big stretch of ocean in between .
if i be to describe accurately and succinctly my estimation of that post , -CONST--0 , i might be ban .
i shall content myself by simply say that you be utterly ignorant of where NE_person-0 might have be , and what his experience or feeling might be , nor do i see his whereabouts as form the basis of any rational argument .
perhaps fortunately , however , you have make no attempt to formulate any such argument .
well be n't that progressive of them...
this be the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time they 've do so .
the most amaze thing though be NE_state-0 , often describe as the very heart of NE_country-0 liberalism , vote conservative on just about every one of the proposition out there .
they do approve assist suicide , but i think vote against every other ' liberal ' proposal .
i honestly think the pendulum be begin to swing back from the far leave .
we can always hope .
once the traditional marriage be safe , then i be confident the people will get busy to provide a way for gay couple to enjoy the same protection as married people do , and i think that will pass with scarcely more than a murmor .
a new report on global warm , the product of a task force of academic , business leader and politician , chair by former NE_person-0 administration transport minister NE_person-1 and NE_political-party-0 ENT_government-organization-0 NE_person-2 , be deeply unsettle .
i love when those that do n't get it claim there can n't be global warm cause it 's -CONST--0 degree and theres -CONST--1 feet of snow on the ground .
that 's actually -CONST--0 of the thing ( record / increase snowfall ) that indicate global warn be take place .
what i do n't get be why some so vehemently deny global warm .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the benefit of deny that it be happen or accept that it be possible ?
ya learn something new every day....
ambergris be use in perfume or as a perfume .
i think it be a type of amber ( a tree resin product ) , but it be totally unrelated .
ambergris be basically , sperm whale trace .
you know how hawk and coyote vomit up the undigestible part of their food ?
so do sperm whale .
the stuff the eject be fould and gross , but after it float in the sun , on the ocean , for many year , it become ambergris - worth a small fortune too.....
there be nothing the -CONST--0 th century whaler prize more highly -- a good haul of ambergris could allow all the ship officer to retire , or buy their own ship -- and allow the sailor to get famously drink , until they be rob and go lookin ' for a new berth...
i find that quite interesting .
imagine break open a chunk of a ambergris and discover something like that...
" hey , NE_person-0 , ENT_amr-unknown-0 the hell be this thing inside the ambergris ? "
" let me have a look .
i believe that be the hard beak of a giant squid ! "
that initial article say it be ban in the NE_country-0 under some endanger species thingie -- ENT_amr-unknown-0 , though ?
it seem like it 's pretty separate from any harm to the animal .
( if they kill one for it , if they get anything at all they 'll some foul @-@ smell bile that have to be float on the sea for -CONST--0 year or more...)
the ambergris itself be consider an endanger species , soz .
it be consider to be a float ecosystem , sort of a microcosm of a rain forest , and every time one be destroy scientist lose valuable information that might have be use for discover a cure for cancer or some other dealdly malady .
NE_person-0 dramatically escalate the extrajudicial killings by NE_country-0 around the world ( mainly in NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 and NE_country-3 ) since take office .
for example , in his ENT_ordinal-entity-0 year in office NE_country-0 carry out more drone attack in NE_country-1 than NE_person-0 's entire presidency .
the next year ?
he more than double his own increase rate .
NE_person-0 be send out these drone to kill people at a rate of once every -CONST--0 day .
NE_person-0 's average be about once every -CONST--0 .
we 've make a new generation of enemy in NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 for these assassination ( and the " night raid " NE_person-0 escalate in NE_country-2 ) .
other than NE_person-0 , nobody we be kill have anything to do with NE_incident-0 .
-CONST--0 decade later many of the young men we be assassinate ( along with the civillians that constitute -CONST--1 of the number kill by these drone ) must have be kid when that happen .
do you think this be a good idea ?
if this be NE_person-0 would you be protest it ?
vote against him ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can NE_person-0 , the greatest drone murderer in history , get away with it with hardly a word about it ?
he even get away with crack joke about predator drone while i know damn well that most of you here would have excoriate NE_person-0 for something like that .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 be it ?
do you all just not know that NE_person-0 have escalate the killings do in your name or do you just not care anymore ?
be war cool now ?
are these kill moral now ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the life NE_person-0 be kill more valuable than the one that NE_person-1 be kill ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be you guy gonna vote for this warmonger ?
when you go on a crusade you do n't pull any punch with -CONST--0 headline , do you , NE_person-0 ?
that 's a bit over the top , don'cha think ?
i state long ago that i no long support him .
i will vote ENT_ordinal-entity-0 party , if at all , since neither major party want to nominate somebody with my value .
i see your point , which you make well on the other thread .
-CONST--0 have a discussion -CONST--1 week or so ago with a old lib friend think about vote for NE_person-0 , and i go on about my old theory about watch for the company someone keep .
that 's from my hematology day , when if you find a blast cell in a peripheral smear , it be very likely a progenitor of the cell around it , thus help identify the NE_disease-0 .
( long ago , do n't know what they do on that now.)
thus , i might like a NE_political-party-0 , but would worry about the ENT_government-organization-0 that came along with him or her .
i end with say i 'm not all so happy about the " company NE_person-0 keep " either .
i convince her , but my conviction on this be shallow .
she and i be both in despair about NE_person-0 for reason already well discuss on NE_publication-0 re his get along mode .
i 'm not sure she be as trouble by NE_country-0 action around the world as i be , but i think so .
i 'm interested in ENT_ordinal-entity-0 party maverick , but have trouble envision how that would work out even if i approve of the candidate .
could NE_person-0 work out ?
NE_person-0 as an independent ?
or , get elect in the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 place ?
given a NE_political-party-0 in office , one of those in the present batch of candidate , i have more trouble not see thing get worse in some ugly way re the economy and how life would work for the struggle with little income .
i 've despair with president before , though .
so , let say a NE_political-party-0 be elect - i can imagine increase polarization in the citizenry as an outcome .
it might result in real change - but in just ENT_amr-unknown-0 way ?
you sound like you 'd rather see that than put up with dem mediocrity any further .
on that , i both see your point and am not there yet myself .
why , i 'll say i fear thing be worse ( to me ) for a while might spiral out of control .
here 's a funny one : when i get a job work for the local college i have to show my birth certificate before they would hire me .
mine have be mislay and i 'd ask if there be any way i could work in lieu of find it , but they say : no they would not hire me without a birth certificate .
but NE_person-0 have yet to produce a valid birth certificate and be no president of the NE_country-0 .
not only do it take less paperwork to become president of the NE_country-0 than a tutor at a local college , but the us constitution require the president must be a natural born citizen !
without require proof of birth we have waive this constitutional requirement .
@muarck , note : this be not conservative or NE_political-party-0 agenda .
i 'm a democrat who vote NE_person-0 .
this be just about gross violation of the NE_country-0 constitution .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be you try to fool ?
NE_person-0 produce a valid birth certificate .
it be verify by the NE_state-0 .
it 's be uphold in numerous court proceeding .
it 's be investigate by just about every news organization out there .
but you do n't have an agenda , yeah right .
a certify copy of a birth certificate issue by the state of birth be valid legal proof of birth , acceptable in a court of law .
no one get their original certificate of birth .
those always stay on file in wherever the state keep their vital record .
NE_person-0 have show a certified copy .
it 's be examine several time and declare valid .
the NE_state-0 have verify the original .
give it up . he 's legal
accord to the ap....here 's a local link
i 've be wonder when that 'd be call !
NE_publication-0 have both NE_state-0 and NE_state-1 at " -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 report " but they 're still not colored in .
i be shock that this happen .
i be not unhappy but i be shock .
the tension and animosity on the street in NE_state-0 be palpable .
i 've be threaten physically twice....like i give a shit....
i do tend to stir the pot i realize .
last night at my gig some drunk late night be discuss what to call obama...bandying the usual right wing talk around and i say " i suggest you call NE_person-0 the motherfucking president elect ".
he be n't sure what to say in response to that so he pay his tab and leave
after last night 's event in NE_city-0 , it 's clear that the NE_country-0 do n't want to be a part of the NE_continent-0 ( or just the NE_organization-0 ? ) anymore .
the continent can cope without the NE_country-0 .
but can the NE_country-0 go to a prosperous future without the euro , without the continent ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 alliance be now possible ? just the NE_country-0 , or the a re @-@ organised NE_organization-0 ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 will be the future place of this country among NE_continent-0 , NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , the NE_country-2 ?
the NE_country-0 have say " bye , bye NE_continent-0 ".
i hope they know the mean of " auf wiedersehen "!
@walter NE_person-0 , i can n't remember where i read the analysis , but the conclusion which make sense to me be that currency boundary ultimately imply federal boundary .
to be anthropomorphic , the " NE_country-0 psyche " resist federal union with NE_continent-0 as evidence by their original reluctance to join the NE_organization-0 .
this latest decision be symptomatic of that resistance but economic event will ultimately decide whether " resistance be futile ".
it 's also a sovereignty issue -- and sovereignty be something which the NE_organization-0 have never effectively address .
ever crucial issue be put up for a plebecite , or a vote by nation -- and the population of -CONST--0 or more country , or the ENT_government-organization-0 of -CONST--1 of more country , torpedo the deal .
as a " union , " it 's farcical .
not too long ago , when NE_person-0 campaign for the presidency , he be all about human right .
and man do he chastise the NE_political-party-0 ' approach to them .
time and time again , NE_person-0 emphasize ( and i 'm quote from memory here ) that under his rule NE_country-0 would n't lead the world through the example of its power , but through the power of its example .
-CONST--0 of his ENT_ordinal-entity-0 act as president be to announce the shutdown of the prison camp at NE_bay-0 , which have come to symbolize the NE_person-0 ENT_government-organization-0 's fast , loose , and secretive approach to human right .
last week , the NE_person-0 ENT_government-organization-0 have a perfect opportunity to act on ENT_government-organization-1 rhetoric , to set an example of NE_country-0 's new spirit , to specifically deliver “ change we can believe in ”.
to understand this opportunity , you have to remember that NE_bay-0 be just the tip of the iceberg .
the rest of the iceberg , hide underneath the waterline from public scrutiny and media symbolism , exist a system of NE_government-organization-0 prison in foreign country .
when the NE_government-organization-0 suspect people of connection to terrorism , it snatch them off the street wherever -CONST--0 live , fly them to those secret prison , and interrogate them .
credible report allege that the NE_government-organization-0 use torture to extract information from them .
( i 've write about -CONST--0 of the victim a little over -CONST--1 year ago ) .
when some of the victim be try to pursue their case in federal court , the NE_person-0 ENT_government-organization-0 try to throw out their -CONST--0 on a theory about ENT_government-organization-1 secret .
NE_person-0 , consistent with the rest of his human right rhetoric , sharply criticize NE_person-1 for it .
but now that NE_person-0 's secrecy theory be before an appeal court , NE_person-1 be change his mind .
without qualification , he be now stick to the NE_person-0 position that torture victim cannot sue the NE_government-organization-0 , because the torture be a state secret .
“ change we can believe in ”?
yeah right .
that be so -CONST--0 year ago !
it 's what most politician would do...but still...sigh .
the hell of it be to whom do we turn .
the NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 policy that have put us in this position ?
we all vote for NE_person-0 because of these policy but ENT_amr-unknown-0 do we turn to really gain a ENT_government-organization-0 of the people for all the people .
NE_political-party-0 , NE_political-party-1 , all i see be crook politician who be only interested in thier own gain and screw the rest of us .
well it be n't just campaign promise , he repeat it in his inauguration , when he already have the presidency in hand .
" we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideal ."
apparently he be miss some qualifier , so i 'll fix it for him :
" we sometimes reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideal when it be politically convenient ."
yeah , i just see this for the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time too .
do n't look good , but i do n't know anything beyond what 's here .
NE_person-0 -- ENT_amr-unknown-0 's the last time you see me say anything about NE_person-1 , yay or boo ?
i 'm still in politics detox mode and still just not follow this stuff .
also just plain not on NE_organization-0 much .
this happen to be recently reply to when i check in just now .
-CONST--0 wonder which couple of year he be referring to .
the power of propaganda .
even half @-@ way intelligent people just automatically repeat this propaganda that 's be drive into their head .
interest use of subject @/@ object pronoun .
-CONST--0 have be busy the last few day .
today be the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 i hear about the story on NE_publication-0 .
i admit i do n't know the fact but on it 's face i disagree with the decision .
it 's -CONST--0 day old ?
it certainly have n't make it into my paper unless i skim over it .
gush like teenager about their ENT_ordinal-entity-0 crush ? i do n't gush NE_person-0 .
this be n't really an endorsement of torture and rendition , be it ?
with nothing to go on except the link to the NE_newspaper-0 article , it look more like there be n't go to be legal action against NE_government-organization-0 and the unnamed NE_company-0 subsidiary for activity they be assure be legal at the time .
i never feel oblige to report every screwup make by the previous ENT_government-organization-0 .
there be so many better qualify people to handle that .
i 'm very close to break point ,
i 've love the same girl for about -CONST--0 year .
-CONST--0 've kept it to myself forever , then tell a friend a few month ago cause -CONST--1 just could n't cope anymore .
then a week 1 @/@ 2 ago , i declare my love for the girl in a text when i be drunk .
she eventually reply a couple of day later be unbelievably kind about it , which have really just make me fall even deeper ( if this be possible ) .
i tell her she would n't hear from me for a while , you know , so i can attempt to move on .
so now i 'm at the start of the move on phase , but i 'm just stuck .
i cut off most of my hair and i 've start exercise and change my diet to try to alter the chemical in my body to make me feel better that way , but do n't seem to be work , i 'm still miserable .
a song about love will come on my itunes ( pretty much every song in the world ) or a song that remind me of her , and i 'll just break down .
i feel like just drop out of uni and get on a flight to NE_country-0 and never come back .
during a really low point last week i cut myself ( which i have n't do in ENT_temporal-quantity-0 ) just because -CONST--0 have so much pent @-@ up emotion , -CONST--1 have to let it out somehow .
i really do n't know what to do or how to help myself be happy again .
people say time be a healer but i do n't know if i 'll be able to hold out that long !
find activity to occupy your time .
there have to be something you really enjoy do ?
set some goal for yourself . i.e.:
- go to the gym -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 -CONST--1 week for -CONST--2 hour a day .
- read x book in -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
- platinum all the NE_game-0 .
- meet -CONST--0 new person -CONST--1 day and engage in a meaningful conversation .
- learn a new skill ( could be play an instrument , draw , try a new sport , web design , etc.).
just some example .
find an activity you like , set some goal , stick to them .
the key be to occupy yourself and meet new people .
maybe make a new playlist on itunes for starter , with happy music . ' NE_music-0 ' by NE_organization-0 , etc.
thing that do n't make you think of her .
try , like /\ /\ suggest , get a hobby , go to the gym etc.
it won't be easy , but it 's just one of these thing in life .
try count all the thing that you do have in life ,
sure you might not have her , but i 'm sure you have a number of other thing .
you 're in uni arn't you ? ?
well , a large percentage of the population do n't have that , and i 'm sure you can finish the list .
it might seem impossible at the moment , but pick yourself up and live life with as much energy as you can .
talk to people on here be always a place to start , have make some wonderful friend on here
turn to religion .
when i be in your exact same position i turn to religion and NE_religious-group-0 have work very well boost up my self @-@ content .
i really like this girl and she 's in a few of my class at university .
everytime i look at her i find her look banck at me .
regardless i do n't know her that well but i fancy her a lot .
i be go to ask her out but for the past few week -CONST--0 've be wait for the right ENT_temporal-quantity-0 ( which never come , partly coz -CONST--1 'm scared ) .
but be valentine NE_festival-0 , should i ask her out and give her a card , or would that be cheesy .
maybe i should just wait for valentine to go .
i see her tomorrow and i could approach her .
i sometimes worry what her mate will think of me , i do n't know i 'm nervous but it have to be do so i can move on i guess
forget about the friend ; if she 's a nice girl , go for it !
be casual , as you run the risk of come on too strong if you do anything seriously NE_festival-0 @-@ y .
i would suggest wait until thursday or so ( let the NE_festival-0 aura float by a bit ) , and then ask her if she 's get plan sunday afternoon for coffee .
low pressure , maximum talk time .
good luck !
well , in my estimation , while it be " romantic " to ask on NE_festival-0 , it 's also high @-@ pressure .
it 's your decision , obviously .
either way , coffee date ( or something similar.)
and do ask !
ask as soon as you can manage to get it off your chest .
ask my girlfriend what fantasy she want to indulge in , turn out she want to have a threesome with a lesbian @/@ bi friend of hers that 's want to **** her for age .
and yes the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 party be fit and have let my gf touch her before .
my girlfriend be straight but she get a kick out of pleasuring people , if that make sense .
i 'm really kind of split on the issue tbh , i do n't have much experience with this sort of thing , if i be in a no @-@ string relationship they would be no stop -CONST--0 , but i can n't help feel that go through with it would spoil thing between us .
but then again we 're young and it be something i 'd like to kick off the bucket list , as it be .
anyone have any experience with this before ?
good or bad ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 should i look out for/ be careful of , really do n't want to ruin thing with my girlfriend , but the idea of a threesome be thrill , not gunna lie .
not really , threesome in relationship can really cause issue ,
not to mention the reality be oft very different from the fantasy .
im sexually open mind but theres no way id share my gf with a boy or girl .
if im single yeah sure , attach no way .
if my gf suggest it id tell her no , straight out .
sorry but i dont share .
oh and ive have threesome before someone say it - both mmf and ffm
if you be n't plan on be with this girl forever then go for it .
if you 're engage or some **** then best not to .
if her friend have want to ' f**k her for age ' i doubt it will end well
apparentley threesome can really ruin relationship , as they can make people insecure and unconfident .
fantasy be sometimes better than reality .
if you have any insecurities at all , then i would recommend you not do it .
like people have say , in theory , it 's great .
in reality , thing be a lot more complicated .
-CONST--0 've be with my girlfriend for well over -CONST--1 year now , and -CONST--2 'm quite selfless towards her .
i do everything i can to make her life easier and better , and we both love each other .
it mean that i spend generously if need and put a lot of time and effort into the relationship .
however , the other night , i bring up " the future ".
as in , think about where we 'd be a couple year from now and how serious she be about stay with me .
turn out , that she do n't really like me that much when we start date and she be just see how thing go ( although now she say she be very happy , but surprise , that she have stay with me this long ) .
i ask her what she think about where we 'd be and she say she do n't want to think about that , and that i should be happy about the experience we 've have ( which i be ) .
my issue be that , should i continue put so much effort into her if it just seem like i 'm " what 's good right now " for her , although it seem as if she do n't want to make any plan or even hope to stay together for a long time .
it just seem unfair that i 'm put in a lot more effort into this relationship and that if we do break up , she 'd have gain a lot more than -CONST--0 do as a result .
any thought ?
in your situation i would say enjoy the moment you 're in now .
currently i 'm on the fence in regard to get more serious with a guy who be technically still marry , have -CONST--0 children and have openly tell me do not want to get marry again or have any more kid .
if you ever find yourself in a situation like this think about the future early on be a must in my opinion because there be a lot more at stake .
my boyfriend have one of those job where he 's on call a lot .
this year he 's on call for our anniversary .
this happen a lot .
he say we 'll not make reservation but we will make plan etc but not to bank on it .
i 'm not angry at him @- i 'm in uni and i know how it be for thing to change suddenly .
but i need to find a way to cope with this .
if i get all dress up and sit wait , he often text me say he have to cancel .
the disappointment be horrible .
if i do n't get ready , he come home and i 'm in my pjyamas , not shower or ready in anyway .
it ruin the night because i have to run around and get ready and i do n't get to do any of the thing i want to .
be there anyway to
bless you i know where -CONST--0 're come from .
my boyfriend be a bobby so he often have to stay late because of a job , he 's be hour and hour before get back .
it make it harder because we 're in an ldr so we have little ENT_temporal-quantity-0 together anyway and with me at uni and him with only -CONST--0 day off -CONST--1 week now in comparision to the -CONST--2 @/@ -CONST--3 it 's hard .
i do n't think you can not get disappoint .
the job demand it .
i realise that and sound like you do too but it do n't make it any easier .
it 's just something we have to deal with .
value the moment you do get to spend together , try not to plan thing in advance if thing be likely to cancel but be prepare for a bit of spontaneity , maybe have an outfit already in your head you could wear at last minute ?
it 's frustrate , you 're not alone in feel the way you do .
-CONST--0 'm study abroad for -CONST--1 year and my boyfriend be go to come visit me a few ENT_temporal-quantity-0 time .
should -CONST--0 pay for some/half/any of his plane ticket ?
i feel bad when -CONST--0 have all this spare loan money and he 's have to save up for week to come see me , which be something we both want .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do i do ?
i 'd discuss it with him -
i do n't do abroad , but when my ex and i be apart he 'd pay for -CONST--0 ticket and i 'd pay for everything whilst he be stay at mine -@ food , transport etc ( when he let me anyway ) .
so really it depends on how much the ticket be cost .
i guess as he 's have to save up that live cost wont cover it .
-CONST--0 'd suggest either half , or if it make him feel less bad about it , alternate - so he pay for the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 trip , you pay for the ENT_ordinal-entity-1 etc.
when i live abroad my boyfriend at the time would pay for his flight
( they be n't much luckily ) and i would pay for most of the stuff when he be there ; eat out...etc .
so my life 's be quiet now for a pretty long length of time...
i'v have the occasion of see guy , but it never end good or last long .
since -CONST--0 last year i havn't be in a proper relationship and life 's get a bit too quiet for my like .
i can n't seem to meet any new genuine guy .
their all ' manwhores ' to put it bluntly .
some that -CONST--0 meet , -CONST--1 'll be physically attract to them..but they have no personality to them..you could say their like male barbie doll .
however , some i will meet who have such a lovely personality , but i wont be attract to them physically .
i can n't seem to find someone with that ' connection ' if you know what i 'm say .
im start to feel like it 's me who be the problem .
i can n't seem to find anyone who be n't just interested in sex...
advice -CONST--0 ! ?
use your gold digger ability and find a rich man .
meh i have the same problem just in reverse .
it do get a bit demoralising sometimes when everyone around you be in a relationship , especially now which be probably the worst time of year to be single .
i would n't blame yourself though , you probably just have n't have an opportunity come along .
i 've meet plenty of nice girl at uni but it take a lot for me to actually develop feeling for someone , and i can n't say i 've meet anyone who i genuinely have feeling for .
i 'd rather wait until i do then find a girlfriend for the sake of it - try and think of thing that way ?
just have to keep put yourself out there i guess , if you 're constantly meet new people or get better acquainted with people you already know , an opportunity will come up eventually .
theres a fair chance you 've catch someones eye already and they 're keep quiet about it
so me and my ex broke up about 2 and a half month ago .
do n't know how it all happen but she say she 'd like to see me during the NE_festival-0 holiday .
now i have this weird thing go on with this breakup.. for the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 -CONST--0 week i feel totally heartbroken , then i be get on good for a while , then go back to be really sad , etc.
before i come back i feel like i be over it ; then i come back , and suddenly , yet again feel unhappy .
it 's really goddamn annoy .
either way , from what i 've heard , she be n't really the same kind of person she be when we be together ( in a good way for me ; apparently like the kind of girl i 'm not interested in ) , so meet with her might totally kill whatever residual feeling there be and i can get on with my life .
or it won't work and i 'll spiral back into sadness .
or we may get back together , since she tell me she might feel differently in the future . ( ie , want me back , after a break that 's less ' stressful '; not that we ever have a stressful time.. ) .
i do n't think this be ideal , but i 'm an idiot . i know i still feel kind of possessive over her..
i hate the thought of her with another guy .
so should i meet with her ? or not ? or delete her out of my life entirely ? or what..
depending on what you want .
if you want her back , do it .
if you want to be over her , do n't go .
i would say -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 chance that will end up feel even more sad than you be if you go see her , coz feel do n't just die in -CONST--1 month ( unless there be nothing at the start ) .
i meet up with my ex after -CONST--0 year of no contact at all and still feeling come back .
so yeah , do n't fool yourself . whatever that girl be do now be probably just a pretend , try to move on , be a change person , ect ect .
do n't expect to feel nothing when you see her .
ok its very important to know this quote : " once a girl leave her boyfriend , the only reason she might wanna be back be to hurt her bf "
dude , do n't meet up with her even if you love her to death because once you have break up , there be no way back and all this meet will do to you be to make you feel upset afterwards .
i be in the similar situation couple of momth ago and -CONST--0 just keep this girl away from me and you ought to do the same since -CONST--1 something be over , then it be over
i really need advice .
me and my boyfriend start date when we be -CONST--0 , and we 're now at uni still go out .
he 's always be the sweetest guy , -CONST--0 mean really nice and funny but these past few month thing have change .
he 's have problem at home lately , and thing have be really tough for him .
im surprise how well he deal with it all .
but recently i 've learnt not to bring it up in conversation or he 'll get really angry about it .
i do n't want to go into detail but lately he 's be get agry at the slightest thing , and if i can n't calm him down he 'll get violent especially after a drink .
he 'll always laugh it off afterwards as if he didnt mean it , and i know he doesnt because he be a good guy .
i 've try talk to him about it several time , tell him i 'll leave him if he do it again but -CONST--0 hasnt stop , and he have such a hold on me i dont think i could never leave him .
im so emotionally drain and dont want any friend to know because they 'll just think bad of him , when really he be good deep down .
sorry for the ramble , i just need to get that out .
i 'm post anonymously because what -CONST--0 be go to say be very personal .
just over -CONST--0 year ago my girlfriend step @-@ father be hurt her mum .
my girlfriend go to help her mum and in turn be hit over the head by a glass bottle . as you might expect the police be call and the prick be arrest .
he appear in court the next day and plead not @-@ guilty to assault her mum and assault her to her injury ( serious assault in NE_country-0 ) .
now this be where my story get really sick .
i type this and i be full of rage .
my girlfriend mum write to the court and ask for her husband bail condition to be drop as well as for the charge to be drop .
she tell the court not to write to her at her own address or phone her home - this stopped my girlfriend from find out what her mum be up to .
in NE_country-0 , domestic abuse charge be not drop if a victim request for them to be drop .
though the bail condition be drop by the NE_government-organization-0 in NE_city-0 - this allow the cowardly little prick to contact my girlfriend , her mum and enter the family home .
we find this out on -CONST--0 -CONST--1 rd -CONST--2 at about 7.30pm when her mum phone her to say her husband be back in the house and want to talk about what happen .
we phone the police because as far as we be aware bail condition be still in place .
there be nothing they could do .
her mum kick her out on NE_festival-0 -CONST--0 to allow the prick to stay .
i be rage .
see my girlfriend in tear at -CONST--0 year old be absolutely heart @-@ break for me .
i do not know how to help but all i do be worry and worry .
my behaviour start to change , i have recently start a career in the NE_organization-0 but due to stress i start to develop problem .
i be eventually referred to a psychologist by my gp to deal with anxiety .
when the case go to trial , her mother lie and say my girlfriend attack him .
the **** be find not @-@ guilty .
my girlfriend be heart break .
i lose it , i go absolutely crazy .
if my mum have not calm me down then i would be in prison just now .
-CONST--0 year on and my girlfriend have forgive her mum .
they live in a flat and the mum disappear at the weekend - -CONST--0 point if you can guess who she go to see .
i have not forgive her mum .
i do not visit the flat when her mum be in .
i have have argument with her mum where i have say some absolutely vile thing which i be not in the least bit proud about .
i have ask my girlfriend to stay with her dad as i still worry .
basically me not like her mum affect our relationship a little bit - if we be ever to take the next step and eventually get marry then i do not know how we would do it , though my girlfriend assure me that we would manage somehow .
i still think about the incident a lot .
what i be try to say be that domestic abuse do not just affect you - it will affect everyone you care about .
-CONST--0 take what i have say to heart and leave this guy .
been with a guy for over -CONST--0 year .
he 's be act really weird recently .
he have n't pick up literally -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 of my call .
have n't return any text either .
i do get to speak to him the last time -CONST--0 ring him ( after him blanking -CONST--1 @/@ -CONST--2 call ) and i ask him what 's up but he do n't tell me ( this be over -CONST--3 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 ago ) .
the fact that its a long distance relationship do n't make it any better .
he do this before -CONST--0 -CONST--1 year ago as well over nothing but i can n't really remember how it proceeded...i guess he just gradually start call again .
apart from this , we have have a very love and almost perfect relationship .
i 'm start to lose trust in him now .
i do n't know if i 'm overreacting , but i just feel really hurt about the way he 's neglect me again and i 'm literally cry as i write this .
i let him get away with it last time but i 've have enough .
i do n't know what i aim to achieve write this on a student forum , but any idea on what should i do ? be it worth end the relationship ?
i do n't wanna ring him any more because i feel insult that he just casually blank my call .
and ask him do n't help either since he 's not gunna tell me .
hmm...good few issue here .
personally , i do n't think long @-@ distant relationship would be successful .
the play hard to get , in reflection to what others have say , be clearly not to way to go , since you 're already live far from each other already .
i think that there 's a range of possibility as to why he 's act this way :
1 ) he 's get something to hide .
if you 're say he act this way before about -CONST--0 year ago and then perfectly fine later on , there 's clearly something go on in his mind .
i do n't know if that 's cheat or if there 's something else , but there 's clearly something he 's not share with you
2 ) he 's feed up with the relationship .
3 ) he 's autonomous and need a lot of space .
i 'm exactly the same .
even if it 's a long distant relationship , sometimes receive phonecall ( depending on how often you 'd call him ) could actually affect his perception on how he feel about the relationship .
i think if you be to give him a ' taste of his own medicine ' then effectively you might receive the response -CONST--0 're expect but i think what 's miss here most be communication .
when you see him next time , do n't criticise or start questioning him .
just express your worry to him and maybe you 'll get something out of -CONST--0 .
edit : i do n't understand the neg .
ok so -CONST--0 be female and like male , always have , obsess with a few male celebs and see myself wth guy .
however occassionally i seem to have feeling for older female but i 'm not sure if they be like sexual feeling and it 's quite confuse .
for the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time there be a female who i like whos quite a bit older and i definitely have feeling .
i know that she be n't straight .
i deliberately try to talk to her and spend time with her even though shes clearly quite a bit older .
perhaps they be more feeling because i look up to the person ?
i 'm really not sure , do anyone have any idea ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do this mean ?
it seem strange when i be physically attract to men ?
if you 're physically attract to men and you 're not sexually arouse by her , i 'd say you have your answer there it might be that you get nervous and your heart beat faster because you be anxious to please her , or her opinion of you matter to you ?
if you scour the forum and do a search , you 'll see that you 're not the only one who have ever feel like this about a teacher of the same gender .
i use to - in fact , still ! - attach to female teacher and tutor a lot .
my counsellor have great fun dissect it and tell me how i 'm sexually attract to mother figure , but he be just an arse
i be n't in a relationship with this guy but we 've be see each other .
in ENT_ordinal-entity-0 year we be always together in the same group of friends..
it be fine .
now in ENT_ordinal-entity-0 year , he 's decide he do n't want to see me anymore .
he want to be ' friend '.
but i know he do n't really want to be friend at all .
i think he 's get someone else.. and that 's why he 's finish it but i do n't really care that he 's finish it .
what i do care about be that i 've be completely cut out .
he life in the same place as me and have n't speak to me -CONST--0 since .
i 've be cut out of night out , get togethers.. etc all because i 'm not see him anymore .
this really upset me , i want to be friend with him and i 'm willing to be but he seem to have cut me out so now i 'm not see other people either
really hate it .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can i do/say ?
other people have cut me out because i 'm not with him anymore either !
this be what you do :
in future you make your own friend , not someone elses .
this be what you say :
oh well , life 's not over .
my ex cut me out as soon as he get a new gf even though he promise to be friend , and that be -CONST--0 month ago
so my best piece of advice be try to move on
its bloody hurtful and hard
at first i spend the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 -CONST--0 week cryingmy eye out not sleep , then it end up that i feel i have do something wrong and therefore he dump me
he let me blame myself and for week -CONST--0 keep think what if -CONST--1 have say this or done that , and then i find out him and his new gf be togther behind my back and i be nothing to do with it , .
so i think if you have like -CONST--0 other friend go out with them , maybe get a job or hobby and meet new people show him you dont care these boy love to think we be sit at home wait for their text which we might be but they cant know that
i have never do something like this before , but i have nobody to ask/ talk to for advice as i cant tell anybody i know
my ex boyfriend have be with me for about -CONST--0 month when he go to uni he cheat on me and dump me .
he be now in a official relationship with the girl he cheat on me with , becuase of this we have no speak since he dump me -CONST--0 month ago
it be a very very very bad break up
however when we do break up i be a bit of a idiot and beg him not to leave me becuase i be in love with -CONST--0 ,
however ive be feel ill for a few week and go -CONST--0 go to the doctor she say im potentially pregnant .
im freak out
yes i need to do a test but i dont know when as i cant let anybody find out ,
also i feel i cant tell nmy ex as he think everything -CONST--0 do be for his attention to gain him back ,
if i tell him i might be pregnant he willl assume im lie to break up him and his new gf which im not but i dont know what to do
im scare and i dont know how i can tell hiim without him accuse me of be a liar .
she say you 're " potentially pregnant "?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 kind of a doctor would say that without give you a test ?
do a test and get it all over and done with
how about you do a test first and then think of the how to approach it ?
...take it from one who know , no doctor be go to tell you that you might be pregnant , and then send you home to deal with it .
i do n't understand why you have n't do a pregnancy test .
they only cost about £3 or so .
get on and do it and then sort yourself out .
go straight to the doctor .
like get up and go now .
they 'll give you another test just to make sure ( however pregnancy test be rarely wrong when they read positive ) .
they will discuss -CONST--0 option with you and probably direct you towards some people who can give you counsel if you ask .
your option be obviously : termination , continue with pregnancy and have the child adopt , continue with pregnancy and keep the child .
first off , it 's best that i explain that i 've barely any experience with girl .
i 'm in my ENT_ordinal-entity-0 year of uni and i , um , ' open my account ' in the sexual world the other night with a girl at my student union .
we 've meet a few time before and have quite a few mutual friend , so she be n't a complete strange .
went back to hers for the night ( she choose that location because she have lecture the follow morning ) and think i handle the actual sex relatively well...
the problem i have lie in the aftermath .
i can be pretty insecure at time ( it 's a wonder i actually make it back to hers , because i be worry i be impose too much ) , and when i wake up i panic and say i have to go and get some work done ( which i genuinely do , although think back on it , it be a weak reason to leave ) .
she decide not to go in for her lecture ( which i eventually realised be probably a hint for me to stay for a bit ) and we have a pretty friendly chat whilst i collect my phone , key etc. together .
she even ask if i want her to come back to mine , but i refuse and say something stupid like ' nah it 's okay , have a lie in ', which i 've be kick myself for .
i just get myself into a panic and have a mental block .
so -CONST--0 leave , and sent her a light @-@ hearted text a couple of hour later apologising for leave so hastily and hope that she have a good night... and do n't get a response .
from here , i do n't know where to go .
to her , i probably come off as someone who do this all the ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , and she be just -CONST--0 girl on a list of -CONST--1 i 've have -CONST--2 night stand with .
i just feel like i be a bit clinical and almost rude , especially with her ask if i want her to come back with me .
all i want to do now be somehow show her that i 'm not an absolute prick , without seem too desperate or clingy .
i realise the error of my way , and have beat myself up over it massively ever since i leave hers...
i do n't think it 's a completely irretrievable situation , because she 's genuinely a lovely girl , and i reckon i can convince her i 'm not the womanising idiot she ( probably ) think i am... but my lack of experience with girl leave me with no idea what to do .
help , -CONST--0 ! ?!?
i see what you mean .
i 'd suggest give her another text ask perhaps to meet up - cinema , dvd , or grab a coffee @/@ lunch before lecture or something .
if she ignore this too then just move on to the next
then again , she mightn't want anything serious , so just go slow .
just text her and invite her to go out .
to clarify be you just look to ' have fun ' with the girl , or be you cool with the idea of go a little serious ?
i get the impression she like you and be maybe look for something a little bit serious than occasional banging..
i 'm not really sure , to be honest .
i kinda wanna take it -CONST--0 step at a time .
ask her out for a cuppa could be a good idea , although i do n't want to do that just as a way of say sorry .
i 'd rather clear the air first and show her that i know i make a mistake before get into anything else with her .
you complete bloody numpty
you have learn a valuable lesson
i 'm scared as to how he might react and it 's be -CONST--0 week and i 've still not find the perfect moment to tell him .
also i 'm afraid what if he do n't want to keep it when i really do .
although he 's a couple of year older than me ( -CONST--0 ) , he can act really immature , aggressive , and violent at ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
my parent have come to term with it now after have little mini heart attack , it 's just ENT_amr-unknown-0 can i break it to him ?
i think you should break it to him gentally .
make sure your have a proper convo like one on one and eye contact , then break it to him .
remember it will be a shock to him but hopefully in the end he will pull though and surport you .
i do n't think there be a way to tell him other than just be straight to the point .
regardless of his reaction or personal feeling about pregnancy or abortion , he have a right to know .
talk to him about what you want to do and what he would like to happen .
if you agree , great . if you can n't then talk to your parent might be the next best thing .
well he ask you to get the morning after pill , do you say you would ?
if you agree to take the morning after pill but do n't then that 's quite unfair and he will be annoy .
it 's obvious he do n't want a baby because he be use contraception and even though it fail he do say he want you to take the morning after pill , so do n't be surprise if -CONST--0 do a runner .
you just have to be honest with him and hopefully he will take care of his responsibility .
you say your mum know ?
well break the news with her by your side then , hopefully your boyfriend won't get violent or anything .
give him time to digest the information .
it will come as a shock , particularly if you think you 'd play it safe .
i know you say you do n't think you could have an abortion , but it 's important to talk thing through with him and decide what 's best to do for both of you and , most importantly , for the baby .
yeah i 'll tell you guy tomorrow i 'm just afraid as he 's prone to act violent at time .
+ he tell me to take the pill and i do n't and he 's gonna be like ' wtf there 's no way i can support a child at -CONST--0 and that you should n't be have a kid as you 're not even -CONST--1 yet blah blah blah '...
so i 'll just tell him he do n't have to be involve with our child financially and i just want him to be there for it as a fatherly figure ( which i doubt he can commit to ) as my parent can support us anyways .
this be go to sound harsh and i understand it be your body , but i be go to be brutally honest .
get an abortion .
firstly , you may want to keep it , but think about it in the long run .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 kind of life will the baby live ?
you be still a kid yourself , around -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 i would assume .
i doubt you will be able to give it a good life .
also your boyfriend .
i doubt he will be happy and most of the time , boy in this situation will bail .
he be -CONST--0 , i doubt he have any long term plan to stay with you .
by keep the baby you be pretty much be selfish .
yeah its your body , but there be -CONST--0 people you need to think about :
1. the baby . i can almost guarantee you will not be able to give the baby a good life because of how young you be , and i doubt the father will stay .
2. your boyfreind . he be -CONST--0 , you be drag him down for life at such a young age by keep it .
actually -CONST--0 people .
yourself . you may end up regret it in the long run .
have a baby be a huge responsibility .
this be child have children .
do everyone a favor and have an abortion .
harsh but true .
you will just end up add to the long and miserable statistic .
edit : cant believe i be actually negged for this . truth ****ing hurt .
i 'm confuse , i love him or i think i do so ENT_amr-unknown-0 am i turn off him now ?
he admit to me that he be bisexual we be talk about ex 's and he tell me about one ex who be another guy .
i be shock and ask him why he do n't tell me before , he say he do n't see a reason to tell me because he like me a lot .
he should have tell me , i 'm turn off at the thought of him with other guy and be sexually attract to another guy .
will this feel go away or shall i break up ?
do n't feel guilty for feel like that .
nothing wrong with be bi , but just as bi 's have a taste for guy and girl , some people do n't have a taste for bi 's , if you know what i mean ?
if you 're really into him stick around , maybe it 's just the shock that 's make you feel this way .
maybe wait a few day and see how the news settle with you before make a decision ?
everyone have a past , to judge him on his would be unfair if you love him .
but if it turn you off or you can n't come to term with it then its probably best to break it off .
either way , give yourself a few day to think about it -CONST--0 if you 're not sure .
i 've suffer with excess body hair since i be young , and i be bully because of it through primary @/@ secondary school and now be unable to wear tshirts etc in public because of how paranoid i be about it .
i go to the doctor because of it when i be around -CONST--0 , and they do a blood test but it come back normal so i assume i do n't have NE_disease-0 .
i have very hairy arm for a girl , not thick hair like a male but lot of very noticable , dark and long ( -CONST--0 bleach regularly but it only last -CONST--1 day or -CONST--2 before the root be noticable ) .
i have never shave them because i shave my leg and get terrible ingrown hair , even though i moisturise @/@ exfoliate etc.
i 've try wax but it only last -CONST--0 day before the hair begin to grow back , so it 's really not worth it .
anyway i check out review and after shop around i decide to get the £350 NE_machine-0 permanent hair reduction machine .
the review be on the whole very good , it come with -CONST--0 flash ( it take between -CONST--1 @-@ -CONST--2 flash to do my arm each time i think ) and you need applicator gel which be £3 .
it appear to do exactly the same thing as you would get in a laser clinic , but cheaper and mean i will be able to target any miss hair you might get go to a clinic and it 's obviously private/convenient .
the sale assistant in NE_company-0 be very helpful , and assure me i could get a no @-@ quibble refund if i find it do n't work but she assure me it will .
i 'm go to use it on my arm first of all , because this be the area that affect me the most confidence wise , but will gradually move on to other area .
for permanent hair reduction -CONST--0 will need to use the machine -CONST--1 a week for between -CONST--2 @-@ -CONST--3 week ( although -CONST--4 will probably need ENT_temporal-quantity-0 week ! ) and will start use it tonight .
i 'm quite sceptical over whether it will work but because i 'm confident i can return it , i think it be worth the risk .
i know other girl on here have the same issue with excess body hair , so will monitor the hair reduction over the -CONST--0 week course to let you know how it go incase anyone else be think of buy one
week 1: shave my arm and zap them today , do it in -CONST--0 separate go ( take around -CONST--1 mins to do each arm ) and my sister do them for me just because certain angle be tricky to get to .
on a pain scale i 'd give it -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 ( just feel like a hot , tingle sensation for about -CONST--2 second then fade ) .
will update what the regrowth be like next saturday .
week 2: had to shave my arm again last night all over , hair regrowth not as course or fast as expect but still widespread .
just finish zap them again but this time do it myself , find it to be much quicker .
i be think of buy one of these because i just think it would be the best thing ever to never have to shave my bikini area again !
let us know how you get on !
if this work well i would definitely buy one , i hate shave and my arm be quite hairy as well ( i do n't shave or bleach them but i be self conscious ) , so i 'd love to be hair free forever .
-CONST--0 let us know how you get on
thank for do this , op.
i 've be debate whether to get one of these machine too .
i really hope it work for you .
i hope it work too !
i suffer from excess body hair and would love for a machine that could get rid of it !
be there any way you can use this kind of thing on your face ?
i assume goggle would be necessary but it would be really nice if it be possible .
i have be look both at this and the NE_product-0 , which be a little more expensive , but i keep think it 's too much of an expense for something that i 'm not -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 sure will work .
look forward to hear what your result be like for this , as i 'd love to be able to buy something that would mean i would n't have to shave every -CONST--0 day in the summer !
without any cosmetic enhancement .
tip ? hint ?
in an ideal world i 'd like to hit a -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 .
i ask this because i want to start ' mingle '.
i 'd like to look like ' something special ' for once .
style your hair and cloth help a lot .
a -CONST--0 , almost every girl wear -CONST--1 .
some nice accessory would help too .
dye your hair a ridic colour .
wear really weird earring .
wear clash colour !
bright red ( or orange , or any colour , if you 're confident enough ) lippy .
im really pale and sick of use fake tan...coming out patchy and smell like curry be awful !
i have load of freckle over my body so it doesnt even look nice natural !
i want to start use sunbeds...not to often but just to build a nice natural tan !
but when i go on holiday i burn really easily so i be wonder whether i would burn if i go on the sunbeds or if i build it up it would be gradually get my skin to go tan ?
do n't use sunbeds .
pale freckly skin be lovely , and sunbeds be really dangerous and just not good for you .
sunbeds be very dangerous , especially with regular use and for people with naturally pale complexion , and you say you have ' freckle ' all over your body .
some of these may be mole and so it 's just not safe .
invest in a proffessional fake spray tan - there be more and more salon .
or just be pale and beautiful as i be
i be so confuse and annoy !
my NE_product-0 be perfect for my face a couple of month ago but now my face look dull and...muddy/ashy ?
also my face and chest have a ridiculous colour difference .
i googled NE_product-0 just now and the girl actually look around my skin tone :/
be it possible to go from NE_product-0 to nc45?
my problem be where i should match my foundation to .
my face be medium , my neck slightly dark and my chest so pale ( compare to face and arm ) it 's unbelieveable .
i would actually call my chest an nc 44 .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 do i do ?
i feel i would look ghostly if i use NE_product-0 but then my chest and face would be the same , help !
yes i have to different NE_foundation-0 because my skin change all the time .
i would suggest go to the counter and ask them to match you again .
someone say that NE_product-0 @/@ 35 be meant to be a good shade for ( brown/black ) people who find themselves change shade
if you match it to your chest would n't your neck look weird though ?
i would always say to match to your face as your natural colour will always suit you best .
i 'm very pale NE_ethnic-group-0 and my chest be dark than my face , if -CONST--0 be to match to my chest -CONST--1 'd just look a bit mucky , like -CONST--2 have n't wash in week , and -CONST--3 think that if your foundation do n't completely blend into your natural skintone along your jawline you can look like you 're wear a mask .
i recommend get colour matched to your jawline and then adjust with bronzers/highlighters .
-CONST--0 get my nose pierce a couple of week ago with a stud .
it 's not a bone so it be literally just a stud , similar to earring .
because of this be fall out all the time as theres nothing inside to keep it in place .
i want to change to an l @-@ shape stud , but i 'm worry it won't go in easily because i 've have it pierce with a straight stud .
any advice ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 the hell do they pierce you with a straight stud ?
go back to the piercer and ask for it to be change or find a piercer who will , they should be able to swap it without any fuss .
i have mine pierce with a straight stud , it be flip awkward .
do n't do what i do though , and change it before the -CONST--0 week or whatever , as you will probably get an infection which come up as a nasty wart thing on your nose . d :
the l @-@ shape stud be different to put in to the straight one , but if you get the technique right , once you do it correctly , you can do it again .
you put the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 bit of the l shape in the hole , make sure you can feel the tip of the end on the inside of your nose .
then press firmly , twist slightly upwards and it should slide in .
if you still have trouble , just go see the piercer and they 'll put it in for you
i notice i be get these permanent forehead line and that my face be a bit dry .
i decide to use some moisturizer and its help .
do many other guy choose to moisturize ?
i use NE_product-0 for men :-)
the ENT_temporal-quantity-0 wash on my face , the exfoliating scrub -CONST--0 -CONST--1 week , and the anti @-@ shine moisturiser on a daily basis ( at least ) .
i have try the cheaper NE_brand-0 and NE_brand-1 , and i think they make my skin feel worse .
i use cheap generic moisturiser after shave because my skin get dry and sometimes tender after shave .
i only do it after a shave because otherwise the facial hair stop it from melt into the skin properly .
any moisturiser label as ' aftershave balm ' or ' aftershave lotion ' or ' for men ' etc. be just a big rip off .
it be exactly the same stuff as cheap moisturiser but it be market towards meathead guy who think that moisturiser be ' liek so gay '.
NE_lotion-0 be around £3 @-@ -CONST--0 for a tiny -CONST--1 ml bottle wheras you can get a big -CONST--2 ml bottle of generic stuff for about -CONST--3 pound that have exactly the same effect .
this be just the modern day version of the old ' mansize tissue ' market one @-@ two .
" oh , it have the word ' man ' in it so it be n't gay anymore "
i have grade -CONST--0 acne and it be particularly bad when i ' overwashed ' so i be compel to wash less and to start moisturising ( NE_product-0 , after wash or shave ) in my late teens .
i also use moisturising shower gel or i get bacne , nice
result be my skin be smoother than it be on some teenage girl ! -
go down well with the lady and -CONST--0 look a lot young than my ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , though that 's probably more to do with genetics eh
anyone else get one ?
i be very impress after last month NE_product-0 fiasco...
i get the NE_nail-0 polish in NE_nail-1 NE_lipgloss-0 NE_lash-0 strip lash NE_oil-0 regenerate body oil and NE_product-0 .
what do you all think !
i think that be well worth £10 .
sound good .
i like the idea of the glossy box and be go to sign up a couple of month ago . but i be worry incase i end up with a load of stuff -CONST--0 just wont use .
the NE_product-0 sound good !
i want to sign up but i 'm worry i 'll get a load of rubbish too :/
i try to order a maxi dress online last night from NE_person-0 , but when i enter my detail , i be told the order have n't go through .
so i try inputting my detail -CONST--0 more , to no avail....
so imagine my horror to see that i 'd be charge -CONST--0 time for an item that have n't go through ? !
have anyone be in a similar situation ?
if so , ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you resolve it ?
any help would be appreciate
i read here somewhere that NE_person-0 have go bust ?
i do n't know if they be just close the store or both but i think you should see if they have a number you can call .
i would also call your bank .
i just shave all my hair off and i 'm feel good .
i think i might buy a lace front wig tomorrow though .
my hair be badly damage , it 's something that have to be do , it feel so weird .
i 've always want to do this but never have the courage .
congratulation !
i too would buy a lace front wig if i do it but they 're so damn expensive and time consume to put on .
i do not know whether to buy a foundation primer - they be very expensive , be almost the same price as the foundation ( for example NE_primer-0 foundation primer ) .
are they actually worth it ?
do they make a real difference to your skin , or be it just a market ploy ?
do anyone have any they would recommend ?
thank you in advance !
they 're definitely worth it , but i do n't wear a primer every day so i suppose i 'm willing to pay a bit more for them .
i only really wear a primer if i 'm go out .
depends what your skin be like , really .
as a general rule , if your skin be n't totally perfect , or if it 's a bit oily , then a primer be go to make your foundation last a lot long and look a lot better .
i never use to use it , but in the last few week -CONST--0 've really see a difference .
would you get , or do you know anybody who have get a NE_book-0 tattoo anywhere on their body ?
if you 're confuse ( though i can n't see why you would be ) this be what i be talk about
and there be many , many more...
now , i be as much of a NE_book-0 fan @-@ geek as the next person , but i would never dream of get a huge NE_book-1 montage on my body .
imo , while i do love NE_book-0 and have grow up with it etc. etc. , i know when i be 40+ year old i will look back upon the tattoo and wonder what make me decide to get it .
i can understand why people would want to get it do - it 's declaration of their love for NE_book-0 and stuff , but i personally would n't ever get a NE_book-1 tattoo .
some small quote @/@ symbol do n't look too bad , but that 's just because i can appreciate the sentiment behind it .
but , while i think they do look pretty cool on other people , i know it be just a phase for me and that 's why i would never have it do .
any think or opinion ?
have anyone actually have one done or be think about get one done ?
it 's your body , up to you what you put on it .
sure you will get some funny look and people will judge you .
kind of like those NE_book-0 tattoo 's middle age women get , i find that more disturbing than young people get NE_book-1 tattoo 's - they will probably look back when they be -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 @/@ -CONST--2 and remember their childhood .
yet these people who get the tattoo 's aged 30+ already.... that 's another story .
yeah , i mean , it 's one thing to proclaim yourself as a fan of NE_book-0 , and another thing entirely to parade around as poster for it
tbh , most of what people get be just for the sake of get a NE_book-0 tattoo , not necessarily because of the mean or symbolism behind it...
never.. they do realise that in 50+ year ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , they 're still go to have " NE_thing-0 " tattoo on them..?
imagine try to explain that to your children @/@ grandchildren " yes , i do get a tattoo of something from a fiction book..."
i would never get it myself , but i would definitely love to meet a person who would and be their friend lol....devotion to the next level
i wonder how outdate we will think NE_book-0 be -CONST--0 year ENT_temporal-quantity-0
so after wear glass for about -CONST--0 year now , i think its finally ENT_temporal-quantity-0 to get contact .
i would seriously appreciate some advise from people who use contact already plz ! !
so there be these NE_company-0 one which seem to be quite cheap :
and in contrast there be these one that they sell @ NE_company-0 :
^^^ be almost double the price .
so my question be :
a ) mite sound a bit stupid but would my vision be better with the more expensive one ?
b ) are the ENT_temporal-quantity-0 -CONST--0 better than the -CONST--1 ( as they be cheaper )
c ) say if -CONST--0 do get weeklies/monthlies , can i sleep @/@ go to the shower with them ?
d ) finaly , ENT_amr-unknown-0 shop @/@ website do you recommend and some buy advise would be realy good plz ! !
i 'd recommend go to -CONST--0 optician ENT_ordinal-entity-0 , you need to know your exact prescription , and whether anything else need to be look at , e.g. astigmatism , whether you 'd suit wet one or drier lens .
i prefer the daily one , as there 's no hassle of clean and store -CONST--0 .
you can shower in lens , but i would n't recommend sleep in them .
i 've do it a couple of ENT_temporal-quantity-0 by accident , and -CONST--0 wake up in pain because they 'd move around back and sort of fold over under my eyelid .
i personally would n't go for the cheapest one .
my eye and my teeth be the only thing i do n't skimp on , because it 's so ridiculously expensive when thing go wrong with -CONST--0 that it 's just better to take very good care of them from the start .
hi all , essentially , i 'm look for a " cover @-@ up " ( for lack of a better word ) i can wear ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
i be wonder be primer alone suitable for this ?
the thing be i do n't like to wear foundation at all ( my face feel weird ) .
with regard to tint moisturiser , i have NE_company-0 's tinted moisturiser - it 's okay but i prefer to use it for night 's out or special event .
somehow it still feel heavy on my face .
be there a much light tined moisturiser out there ?
any advice or tip for what would be suitable for me to wear and brand ?
i 'd prefer to keep away from foundation if possible .
thank you !
i know what you say about foundation , but try NE_product-0 .
it 's really light , then use a powder brush to put a light dust of a press powder .
if you 're just look for a blemish cover , NE_company-0 do a blemish stick which cover a multitude of sin .
make sure you remove any make up with a good non greasy cleanser if you do n't want pizza face
primer do n't usually give any coverage .
tint moisturiser give a little , but imo do n't do much at all and i do n't like the feel and texture on my skin .
i use a NE_product-0 as it be ok , but slightly greasy
i 'd just get a really light foundation e.g. NE_product-0
do you remember that movie that be based on nothern NE_book-0 by NE_person-0 ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 come they never make a sequal ?
i be shocked..there be so much hype when it come out...it be so anticipated...x
well in the series of NE_person-0 book , the next one in the sequence be call NE_book-0 , i guess they would make a film of that rather than call it -CONST--0 -CONST--1 -CONST--2 -CONST--3 .
i imagine they would n't make a sequel because the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 film be n't very good .
if they even think of call it " -CONST--0 -CONST--1 -CONST--2 -CONST--3 ", i will go into NE_thing-0 .
it piss me off enough that they change -CONST--0 -CONST--1 to -CONST--2 -CONST--3 -CONST--4 for no apparent reason as it be , let alone ****ing up -CONST--5 rest of -CONST--6 trilogy .
the film sell well in NE_continent-0 but poorly in NE_continent-1 , as a lot of religious group see the film as anti @-@ NE_religious-group-0 @/@ religion and so it get a lot of bad press .
the NE_country-0 market be what matter ( afterall , they take the american title of the book , not the original title ) , so all plan for a sequel be can .
not to mention that NE_broadcast-program-0 strip off all the reference to religion it possibly could , but that 's pretty much impossible in the sequel .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can you kill NE_person-0 without any religious context ?
so if there be bad press for the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 film it 'd only get a -CONST--0 time worse by the time the last film come out .
to many fan it 's difficult to see how NE_broadcast-program-0 could 've even carry the series forward since it leave out a lot of the important part of the magesterium that be develop in the sequel .
in short , if there be ever to be a NE_trilogy-0 'll have to be from a NE_country-0 film production company who do n't care what the NE_country-region-0 think .
it would 've be nice if someone decide to take it on after the NE_film-0 craze die down , but since it 's be try -CONST--0 and fail -CONST--1 think it 's go to be -CONST--2 good few year ( -CONST--3 or so ? ) before anyone think of touch it again .
hopefully if it happen they 'll do a NE_broadcast-program-0 and film it in -CONST--0 big go rather than wait to see if the box office figure validate a sequel . :/
i do n't either but i can see why he 's do it .
NE_person-0 be re @-@ release NE_work-of-art-0 with -CONST--0 additional minute of footage .
people might think it 's a waste of effort , but those -CONST--0 minute will no doubt bring him at least , a few more -CONST--1 $$$ in the bank , just like this 3d crap will for NE_person-0 .
depends on the film , i think it be interest to see NE_work-of-art-0 in 3d , but no other movie since have interest me in 3d ( NE_work-of-art-1 in 3d be a joke )
on the subject NE_work-of-art-0 , as a massive fan since i be a child this sadden me as i would like the film to be leave as they be . ( say that i do agree with the remastering they do for the -CONST--0 th anniversary...)
though be the whore that i am... i will probably splash the cash to watch NE_work-of-art-0 on the big screen again...
NE_city-district-0 money @-@ grabber cash in while contribute to destroy new technology - shocker .
i also disagree with people ENT_amr-unknown-0 would say " ENT_amr-unknown-1 not ? ".
artistic integrity , for instance .
it would be far more appeal to see those film fully remastered in NE_thing-0 , rather than a tacky bandwagon jump , and it would still rake in money .
the problem be " good " be still a long way off the kind of image audience expect .
without the force , an after @-@ conversion will never even begin to look good .
if you have -CONST--0 film , which be n't release in their in @-@ universe chronological order originally , would n't you want to change it for any subsequent release ?
the prequels would definitely be improve with 3d , because like NE_work-of-art-0 they 're all about spectacle and explosion and the " plot " be really just there to string the spectacle and explosion along for -CONST--0 hour .
you can n't tell me you would n't want to see , say , the open battle in NE_work-of-art-0 in 3d ?
that be awesome enough in the cinema anyway , but it could really be enhance by NE_company-0 do their thang .
i be less optimistic about the core film be convince in 3d , because as much as i love their visual effect , they be design -CONST--0 year before people even begin talk about the possibility of 3d as it have be realised today .
they have hold up very well because the story and character be strong , not because the visual effect be up to much , revolutionary though they be at the time .
still , this be NE_company-0 we 're talk about here , hopefully all six film will come out look pretty good .
however what i really want be a NE_product-0 collection of all -CONST--0 .
hurry the **** up , NE_person-0 .
have anyone hear of this film ?
it star , among others , NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 and NE_person-3 .
it have receive some amaze review .
it be go to be officially release here in the NE_country-0 -CONST--0 year in -CONST--1 , but it be go to be show at the NE_festival-0 next month .
i read the screenplay a while ago .
a lot of visual potential but a little weak in the storytelling department .
hopefully NE_person-0 have be able to turn it around , though i 'm not really dig the trailer - NE_work-of-art-0 anyone ?
it have NE_person-0 kiss NE_person-1 in one scene .
it 's safe to say the film will attract viewer .
id play a video game call the NE_game-0 but there be already a film come out .
for those , ENT_amr-unknown-0 have watch it . ENT_amr-unknown-1 be the feedbacks ?
plan to see the movie alone
i think it look awful , personally .
i really can n't stand that actress because she play the most annoy character ever , and her character in NE_work-of-art-0 really grate in just the trailer .
not to mention that the script sound horrendous .
i have n't see it though...
i be gonna ask if i be the only one who thought this , but a quick google search of ' NE_broadcast-program-0 racist ' answer that question .
was the film racist ?
was it intentional , to add to the vapid ignorance of the character ?
was it intentional pro @-@ NE_country-0 propaganda ?
or be i , and many critic , make something out of nothing ?
thought NE_publication-0 ?
it be kinda insult to their culture .
but the whole thing be exaggerate for the purpose of enhance the storyline , e.g the clash between NE_person-0 's rampant sexuality and the " cover up " stereotype of NE_world-region-0 country .
i do n't think anybody should get on their high horse about it , people only insult it because it 's NE_broadcast-program-0 , nobody give a **** about stuff like that in other film .
i be watch NE_work-of-art-0 and i realised how some of the thing in the film apply to me eg push yourself away from people because you 're scare that they 'll find you imperfection etc.
that really get me think about my life and what i need to change so if you have any film that have change you personally or have make you change your outlook on life then plz share .
if you 're think , think about something useful and interesting which will get you somewhere : maths .
i agree there 's more than education .
if you do n't want to think , you could get waste or do something else etc.
if you 're spend your time think , make it useful think , that 's all i 'm say .
NE_work-of-art-0 . NE_work-of-art-1 , i know a lot of people get hook up on the gore and ' sickness ' of it , but the whole point of that film be philosophy about life and it do get me think for a while .
actually it lead to a lengthy , involve discussion at uni in which someone end up cry . so definitely good for think about life .
and if you 're willing to watch something that be n't a film but still go in the dvd player , then any of the NE_person-0 stuff
if anyone have n't say NE_work-of-art-0 yet , then that get my vote !
i see the trailer for it and have yet to see the whole thing , but it look amaze .
and i do n't necessarily think this film be go to make you think hard about life , but.. i also recommend watch NE_work-of-art-0 .
it 's good if you 're into a film noir kinda thing .
cant believe no @-@ one have mention NE_work-of-art-0 , the only ENT_temporal-quantity-0 i have shed a tear infront of the tv since see NE_team-0 loose the NE_game-0 when i be -CONST--0 .
serious stuff , this movie be immense and have affect me more then any other film or tv show .
NE_broadcast-program-0 be pretty good as well as provide laugh .
i dont know if you genuinely believe this or if you be just try to act the adult .
a life have be spent entirely on academia whether it be maths or anthropology at the cost of miss essential human experience be the biggest waste of a life imaginable .
did anyone know ?
NE_product-0 page
the film be class comedy @-@ drama and be supposedly about the creator and the found of NE_company-0 .
NE_company-0 have be around for -CONST--0 year now and the question be , do it warrant a film ?
are the maker hope every NE_product-0 user . around -CONST--0 globally will watch the film ?
bit of a stupid idea how film production company will make a movie about this when there a far better movie script out there .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 not make a film about NE_product-0 ?
that 's get a better found story than NE_company-0 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be NE_person-0 in it ?
are they just try anything to make it big ?
i personally use NE_product-0 and think it 's a useful thing to have , but to be honest ENT_amr-unknown-0 would i want to see a film about it ?
i like see comedy , or thriller , or action films.. but a film about the founder of NE_company-0 ?
yeah -CONST--0 hear about that about -CONST--1 year ago when it ENT_ordinal-entity-0 go into production .
i 'm really interested to see what come of it give the cast and ( especially ) NE_person-0 direct with NE_person-1 scripting ! !!
the NE_organization-0 have announce that they will permit -CONST--0 nominee for the NE_category-0 instead of the usual -CONST--1 .
the reason behind the change be that the NE_organization-0 of fall rating , want to attract more popularity to NE_event-0 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think of this change ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would you do to make NE_event-0 more popular ?
or do you think the rise of the internet and etc will inevitably slowly kill off NE_award-0 ?
i 'm still fume about NE_product-0 not get an NE_award-0 .
similarly , i be still piss that NE_film-0 be award NE_award-0 last year .
it be a travesty !
it be good no doubt , but the best ?
the judge panel just jump on the bangwagon surround the media hype .
i think NE_film-0 should have win the NE_award-0 award , but they do n't even nominate that film .
out of the nominate one , i think NE_product-0 be much better than NE_product-1 .
though NE_product-0 be pretty good as well .
( NE_film-0 and the NE_film-1 be crap.)
so in the last week , the new head of NE_organization-0 , NE_person-0 , have say : “ all teacher should be qualify ”.
what an absolutely preposterous suggestion !
you mean to say that , as citizen of this great nation , our children should be teach by professional people who have go through the necessary rigmarole to be let loose in -CONST--0 school ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 dare we expect that from our education system . and while we 're at it - ENT_amr-unknown-1 stop there ?
let 's round up our homeless and get them work in our hospital .
it 'll get them off the street and straight into promising career .
youth unemployment be rife at the moment so let 's get them pilot our aeroplane .
NE_airport-0 might even get its ENT_ordinal-entity-0 runway so we could do with a few more pilot .
i hear overcrowd in jail be a problem too - especially since the riot last summer .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do n't we just convert the miscreant to our side by give them a uniform and a gun ?
they 're bound to see sense and start make our street safe instead of cause the trouble .
and lastly , with the NE_festival-0 holiday come up , young children will need something to keep them occupy .
maybe they can try write for a sunday tabloid - i hear there be vacancy at NE_publication-0 .
you may have sense my slight sarcastic undertone - although that last suggestion might not be such a bad idea .
call me naive , but i always assume that teacher be either qualify or train alongside someone qualify ?
it seem though that any old sod can do it .
be it any wonder then that the NE_country-0 's position in the international league table have slip ?
so despite sound incredibly obvious , mr NE_person-0 seem to have hit the nail on the head .
problem solve .
i 'm sure it come as a welcome suggestion to all the fully train , out @-@ of @-@ work teacher who struggle to get a job .
not to mention the one who have job and have work extremely hard to get there .
so until then - if you 're pass by your child 's school , you might want to pop your head around the classroom door .
just to make sure one of the dinner lady be n't also teach maths .
all teacher should be able to teach .
some piece of paper from a teach academy do not equate to , by definition , be capable of teach .
i think all we need to do be think of some teacher we have have to know this .
and at the same time i think we can all think of great teacher who have not have a piece of paper from a teacher train college .
with this notion of qualification there be an unholy alliance of -CONST--0 group of people .
the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 be the well intend sponsor who think enforce such rule will improve education by keep so call unqualified teacher out .
the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 be the special interest group , the teacher union , who want to keep competition out so they want a piece of paper that teacher need to have .
this piece of paper be just another barrier to entry for outsider and keep the incumbent teacher safe from competition .
the teacher union hate competition and they have do a very good job of fending off competition under the guise of the public interest
fortunately we have thing like the NE_product-0 now that be go to seriously screw those monopolistic selfish bastard over .
suck on that educational establishment .
this be a story about NE_political-party-0 on NE_newspaper-0
-CONST--0 : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti....html#comments
unsurprisingly the most liked comment defend the NE_political-party-0 , the rest all praise the NE_political-party-1 , whether it be in a stealthy way or openly ( most of the " best rate " comment openly support the NE_political-party-2 ) .
majority of the " worst rate " comment on that site criticise the NE_political-party-0 .
i conclude that most of the reader of that paper be NE_political-party-0 sympathisers or supporter .
p.s i would have be for the NE_political-party-0 if they just be n't racist or present themselves as a " NE_religious-group-0 party which support -CONST--0 value ", some of their policy e.g " get out of NE_country-0 ", " stop be NE_country-1 's poodle ", " kick out muslims who dont integrate ", " eradicate NE_religious-group-1 fundamentalism from britian " e.t.c really interest me .
i wish liberal support the policy i mention
while i too think most of their reader be racist , i think for the majority they be more " friendly " racist than " NE_political-party-0 " racist .
by friendly i mean that while they harbour racist view , they be perfectly polite to anyone of any race and do n't go around be openly racist or discriminate against individual .
still not a great quality to have , but nowhere near the level of vitriole as the NE_political-party-0 .
i would n't compare them directly to the NE_political-party-0 - most of the reader be white middle class people who find many of the change in society scary and the NE_newspaper-0 give them stereotype to blame without use too complicated language .
whilst it 's an awful paper , compare its entire readership to some of the monster in the NE_political-party-0 be wrong .
-CONST--0 post in this thread all discussion relate to the recent rise in tension between the NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 over the issue of the sovereignty of the NE_island-0 .
NE_country-0 be grow quite rapidly compare to the NE_country-1 , but that be beside the point .
if NE_country-0 be to launch a surprise attack and take the island 's airfield , then NE_country-1 would be effectively unable to retaliate due to lack of an aircraft carrier .
keep pretend everything be fine , though .
NE_country-0 - yes .
NE_country-0 's arm force - no.
NE_country-0 launch a surprise attack ?
well , it would certainly be surprising , not least to the member of their arm force use the same kit they do in ' 82 .
they 'd be astonish to learn that they have suddenly discover the requisite experience , train and equipment to make such a land possible .
not to mention we have the southern hemisphere 's most capable attack aircraft station on the fis .
yes , we 're without an aircraft carrier , mean we cannot retaliate in the same way we do in ' 82 .
however , this do not mean we cannot retaliate .
we 've prove that the NE_aircraft-type-0 can fly from NE_island-0 to the falklands .
the NE_military-0 can still launch a task force that would , if allow to fight openly , utterly decimate the NE_country-0 navy and we retain the ability to launch NE_product-0 directly through NE_person-0 's window should we wish .
they would have to be suicidal .
pretty cool eh ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do people think about in @-@ vitro meat ?
would you eat it ?
as a matter of interest to the vegetarian and vegan out there , if it be n't mix with blood , and be simply stem @-@ cell grown , would you eat it
( i can see why vegan might be oppose , but i 'm unsure about vegetarian )
if it benefit my health then i would probably eat it .
sound interest . though i doubt they 'll be able to replicate the taste of a good bit of beef any time soon .
for fast food place where the meat they use be terrible anyway it should n't affect thing much .
it might be the key to the survival of the human race .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do vegetarian view this ?
all the thing they could research to do with stem cell and they come up with this ?
time be run out for the NE_regional-group-0 to return home .
these people be illegally remove from their homeland to make way for the NE_country-0 military base on NE_island-0 , lease to the NE_country-1 from the NE_country-2 for a -CONST--0 year period , which could be renew for a further -CONST--1 year in -CONST--2 , if the NE_country-3 so wish .
i 'd urge anyone to watch this video for deep understand of this atrocity : - -CONST--0 : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=1ocqqn_uoiy
if you be short of ENT_temporal-quantity-0 -CONST--0 take a few minute to watch this : - -CONST--1 : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=qflhb_skmig
after witness these event , i hope us educate tsrians have the view that democracy should prevail , and no one should be forcibly remove from their home .
not many know about these atrocity , but help spread the word .
and -CONST--0 sign this petition to raise awareness , and hopefully ( yes , be very hopeful here ) it will one day be debate in the NE_government-organization-0 . -CONST--1 : //epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/4685
thank you .
i sign it .
with all the stuff go with the NE_island-0 , i think this make the NE_country-0 seem a bit hypocritical .
i 'll sign the petition if you remove the highlight part from your post .
it 's inflammatory and a cheap attack on coalition force .
when actual innocent civilian do die it 's regretable , but we both know that they be n't the intend target .
you clearly put that there to win brownie point with the anti @-@ war crowd despite this issue have nothing at all to do with the conflict in NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 and infact bomber operation out of NE_island-0 completely cease over -CONST--0 year ago .
i happen to watch a news review on NE_organization-0 this morning in which a bunch of journo 's be bleat on that we should n't condemn all the " innocent " and hard work journalist at NE_organization-1 just because a whole bunch of hack at NE_organization-2 be arrested...
because that would cause untold damage to the whole media industry .
oh poor them .
this be precsisely , be it not ? , what the whole media have be do to the bank industry for the last -CONST--0 year or so ?
total hypocrisy .
it be important to seperate the innocent from the guilty in both industry but it 's ironic that the paper have be sell copy by basically tar all banker with the same brush and slagging them off mercilessly for ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
isnt NE_organization-0 own by NE_organization-1 which be own by NE_organization-2 or something ?
it doesnt surprise me though , let hope NE_person-0 go down .
the media condemn banker be akin to a witch hunt , NE_person-0 be give just a £6.5m bonus in ENT_date-entity-0 yet jpmorgan 's top executive be pay $ 21m that ENT_date-entity-1 .
NE_person-0 be employ because of his excellent show of skill after his success in safely defuse the explosive capital @-@ market business of NE_organization-0 .
the media seem to have mix up the man responsible for the merge with NE_company-0 with the man responsible for fix the failure of NE_company-1 .
moral of the story : the media will always present news in a way which forward their view , it 's that simple .
i recently come across -CONST--0 story , one about a NE_person-0 in the NE_country-0 who be arrest and sentence to up to -CONST--1 year for have an " affair " with a -CONST--2 year old girl , and another where a woman in NE_state-0 be give up to -CONST--3 year for have sex with a -CONST--4 year old boy .
for the sake of argument , let say a -CONST--0 year old woman be have sex with a -CONST--1 year old boy and similarly a -CONST--2 year old man be have sex with a -CONST--3 year old girl .
i can n't think of a good reason ENT_amr-unknown-0 either of these scenario should be worse than the other , but deep down i seem to feel that the first scenario be n't that serious at all .
in order to give a reason as to why they be different i 'd have to admit a difference in free will between young guy and girl , which be hard to do .
but for some reason it almost seem like the -CONST--0 year old man be some sort of predator whereas the -CONST--1 year old woman be only misguide .
in keep with this the -CONST--0 year old girl be take advantage of whereas the -CONST--1 year old boy be lucky .
note that in both case the sex be consensual , obviously not legally , but in the sense that there be n't any physical compulsion .
so i 'm not say if a -CONST--0 year boy be forcibly touch by a woman it would be ok .
i have a discussion about this with my girlfriend , she think both be serious .
i agree , but also seem to have this almost sexist view that the boy be really hurt at all .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you guy think ?
be it sexism or be sex between teenage boy and older woman just fundamentally different ?
i think it seem less serious because -CONST--0 @-@ year @-@ old boy talk about have sex with an " older woman " as if it be an achievement .
whereas to a -CONST--0 @-@ year @-@ old girl , if an older man be interested in her she 'd consider -CONST--1 a dirty pervert .
therefore it seem unlikely that the girl consent , whereas most would believe the boy would be very much up for it .
well suppose the -CONST--0 year old girl feel the guy love her and want to have sex with him .
it still seem that it 's worse because for some reason i 'd think the man have manipulate her in some way whereas in the other case i would n't really feel the boy have be dupe .
i think this be n't a good way to think about it but it seem fairly prevalent .
yes , i see that .
my point be , people would n't believe that . that 's why it seem worse .
girl : " but i want sex with him ! " - most would assume she be brainwash , groom .
boy : " but i want sex with her ! " - most would assume that yes , he probably do .
anyone else think it 's a bit ridiculous that this man actually get arrest for make a monkey gesture ?
it do n't hurt anyone , and whilst it may be offensive to some , surely this be n't an arrestable offence ?
i mean , ENT_amr-unknown-0 's the line between un @-@ pc and illegal ?
no , i do n't think it be ridiculous .
whilst no one want to stop banter , the intention of this be clear : to cause offence .
it be disgraceful and totally unacceptable .
criminal charge + lifetime ban from all ground methinks .
i 'm a NE_team-0 fan and there can be no excuse for this behaviour .
i hope he be ban from football for life ( not just NE_sports-facility-0 ) .
i honestly do n't understand racist people .
no he should have be arrest .
i hope the NE_league-0 ban him from all match for life , and the court give him a suspend sentence and some kind of community service .
what i do n't understand be in the NE_film-0 , -CONST--0 of the detective , who be white , call NE_person-0 , who be also white , a monkey .
now , unless i 'm miss something here , i 'm pretty sure NE_person-0 be n't black , and monkey mean black person , do n't it ?
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 be this detective use the word ' monkey ' for if it be n't to mean black person ?
i 'm terribly confuse .
it 's short but if you do n't want to read it basically a guy in the NE_country-0 have be arrest for agree to meet up with and have sex with a " -CONST--0 year old girl " who be actually an undercover cop...
surely this be entrapment ?
he do n't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation ?
sure , it would be a crime if he have actually do this with a -CONST--0 year old and something have happen when they meet up...
but the american police have basically create this whole scenario and lead him into it , feed him along ?
this suggest to me that the police officer be the one who suggest everything...
coax him into it...
we do n't know the full story but i get the impression that this " -CONST--0 year old girl " offer him sex on a plate willingly....
would that be legal in this country ?
i mean i think it 's wrong that this guy would meet up with a -CONST--0 year old with the intent to have sex...
but fabricate the situation... you can n't arrest someone for something they have n't done... it 's just wrong...
am i the only one who think this be mess up ?
from previous similar story , what usually happen be that the undercover officer behind the screen be extremely passive ( as a normal young innocent teenager would probably be ) and then agree to meet up with the potential paedophile , if he show up at the place then he be guilty .
i see nothing wrong with this morally , he know the girl be -CONST--0 and still decide to meet her ( have previously state his intention through NE_product-0 ) .
if that be the case then i understand and agree , it 's just the way the article be write it sound as if the police officer be do a lot of the work , and it 's in NE_country-0 so different law to here .
they do this and it work , there be even a show about it .
to me its fine , if the suspect have to make a choice , ie leave his home and go to a location , then i do n't really care if he be encourage .
not that recent but it have go under the radar for month .
it 's graphic so that be why it be in spoiler .
strange that NE_publication-0 keep it up , but it 's not horrifically graphic like thing on NE_publication-1 .
story be basically that they be targeted for refuse to believe in NE_person-0 @/@ NE_person-1 as their saviour .
guess they do n't get the version with the execution part edit out ?
inb4 ''you can n't judge all NE_religious-group-0 on a remote village in kenya''
-CONST--0 'm not , i 'm just post it .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 planet be you on ?
go to the gore websites that dont restrict content and you 'll get so many thing about NE_continent-0 .
the majority of the world may be in the -CONST--0 st century but that crap hole be still in the dark age .
there 's nothing to stop these people what they 're do , either .
i imagine the town be either under the grip of religion , or too scared to protest simply because of the nature of these punishment .
another bullet point on the big list of thing atheist do n't do .
how NE_religious-group-0 of them !
it would be a bit silly to suggest only NE_religious-group-0 have do thing like this .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do we think ?
will this mean a weak NE_country-0 ?
something that struck me watch a NE_broadcast-program-0 debate on this issue be the attitude of some NE_country-0 people , such as the obnoxious NE_newspaper-0 journalist on the panel , that NE_country-1 independence be good because then we would n't have to subsidise them for be poor .
he even make some kind of play on word involve the word " skint ".
NE_country-0 probably receive more than its fair share of NE_country-1 ENT_government-organization-0 spend in term of its share of the population .
i believe this be because it be , on average , poor than NE_country-0 .
the way some english people sneer at the NE_ethnic-group-0 for be poor and therefore receive more ENT_government-organization-0 spend would n't , i presume , be direct at poor area of NE_country-0 .
the north , NE_country-0 , the south @-@ west , east NE_city-0 and many other area of the NE_country-1 get more than their proportional share of spend , because they need it .
i think it 's wrong to resent the NE_country-0 poor for be NE_country-1 , because i 'm sure such complaint would n't be make about poor region of NE_country-2 .
i be also annoy by a woman in the audience who say NE_country-0 should be independent ( she be NE_country-1 ) because " all country should be independent ", include NE_country-2 and " NE_country-3 ".
this be such a simplistic view .
should NE_county-0 be independent ?
should NE_country-region-0 split from NE_language-0 @-@ speak NE_country-0 ?
should NE_country-0 join with the NE_country-1 ?
should NE_province-0 be independent ?
should the kurds be independent ?
should bavarian , or NE_world-region-0 , or sicilian , or catalan , or bosnian @-@ serbs , or NE_province-0 NE_country-0 have independence ?
load of place have their own history , culture , devolved ENT_government-organization-0 , language and so on .
just because NE_country-0 be an independent state -CONST--0 year ago , do n't mean it should be today .
the definition of " country " be more complex than that woman 's personal black and white judgement .
culturally i feel british and i want NE_country-0 to stay together .
but i recognise there be convince political and economic reason the NE_political-party-0 have for independence and i do n't think NE_person-0 's reponse on NE_broadcast-program-0 of " we 're stronger together " have enough real substance to it .
i support him , but NE_political-party-0 need to express in more real term ENT_amr-unknown-0 we 're stronger together .
another interest issue be the advantage to the NE_political-party-0 if NE_political-party-1 @-@ dominate NE_country-0 break away .
the NE_newspaper-0 guy make this point and NE_person-0 immediately quote number prooving that actually scottish mps have never be significant in the balance of power in the NE_government-organization-0 .
( take that sensationalist journalist who have n't get their fact straight ! )
and then there 's the issue of time .
it may well be tactical on the part of the NE_political-party-0 to wait until -CONST--0 , but i think it 's practical too .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 get the NE_aircraft-type-0 sub ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 get the arm force ?
do NE_country-0 stay in the NE_organization-0 ?
do it keep the pound ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 about their oil ?
do the NE_country-0 have a say ?
these be all in my view huge issue .
it 's the biggest decision in -CONST--0 year and it need to be make slowly i think .
give the NE_ethnic-group-0 -CONST--0 year to make NE_ethnic-group-1 mind up , because it 's not as simple as the NE_government-organization-0 want to make out .
i do applaud them though for try to get the legal issue sort out .
i be so tire of this debate , but i guess it 's go to keep crop up .
independence would be worse for both NE_country-0 and the rest of the NE_country-1 .
as NE_ethnic-group-0 be we really so different that we 'd toss aside the political , cultural and economic benefit of the union so that we can massage our own ego and yell " freedom ! "?
there be an NE_political-party-0 canvaser at my door today , so my mum decide to annoy him , and tell him she vote tory... for ENT_amr-unknown-0 he have no response and get all fluster , then when ask ENT_amr-unknown-1 party she would vote for in the next election she say she do n't vote for a NE_political-party-1 , she vote for a person , and he get confuse , then she say she would n't vote for independence , and he be genuinely surprise and do n't know what to say
the NE_political-party-0 seem to think that just because they win the election it mean that the whole country want independence , ENT_amr-unknown-0 actually they probably win the election because they want free prescription , free tuition , free care for the elderly etc. while other party be n't offer as much ( although , it do beg the question of ENT_amr-unknown-1 exactly all this money be come from ? )
now for a bit of intentional controversial and completely ignorant ' tar with the same brush ' type question :
be this what ' NE_country-0 ' people think ?
i know many people do n't think like this bitch but this be appaling .
should she have her kid take away from her ?
you see the other ' NE_country-0 ' woman do n't defend the others but be more concern with have to take care of her baby that be about to wake up , which mean -CONST--0 ' NE_country-1 ' woman be be racist , and the other ' NE_country-2 ' woman be just let it pass , be more worried about something else .
so do that mean that most ' NE_country-0 ' woman think like this ?
you also have to admit that the lady argue with the rave bitch have no reason to say ' we 're here because you do n't work , go find a job ', that 's wrong and a bit racist within itself .
the like to dislike ration on this video be around -CONST--0 @:@ -CONST--1 , ENT_amr-unknown-0 do that show ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think ?
if you allow her to have this opinion be it because you project the same feeling ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would be the point in argue with her ?
the women be so steep in her own ignorance it would take year to educate -CONST--0
she 's entitle to -CONST--0 own opinion .
someone should have just give -CONST--0 a slap just to shut her up
wow , she 's gonna be really piss in about -CONST--0 year . hahaha !
but seriously , if all NE_country-0 @/@ NE_country-1 people be like her.....why would anyone want to be english/british .
i actually think she have something wrong with her , whether she be on drug or drunk .
but she be slur a lot .
the fact she call nigeria... nygigreeah.... i think she be half with it...
no @-@ one in their right mind , start scream and swear like that , with their young child sat on their lap...
also , to say most NE_country-0 women think the same , be wrong .
i 'm a NE_country-0 woman and would never dream of acting like that .
you say the -CONST--0 other NE_country-0 lady do not stand up for the others , but...
1. she actually do , by tell the loud mouth cow to shut up .
2. although she should n't have to , ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think she have to get involve ?
just because she be NE_country-0 ?
3. several other people , who be n't NE_country-0 do n't get involved... do that make them racist too..?
4. if i be in that situation , and i have a child with me , i would try my hard not to get involve , as it would n't be fair on my child .
but if the argue cause my child to be disturb , then i would have do the same and get involve .
i agree that what i have watch in this video be sicken , but i disagree with several point you have make .
and i would actually say some of your point be rather racist and offensive to NE_country-0 women .
you may be angry at what -CONST--0 have see , but that be no reason to group all NE_country-0 women as racist .
seem stab be become as regular as fart , soon there will be so many knife on the street it will bring back the NE_country-0 's steel make to what it be -CONST--0 year ago .
along with tougher sentancing i dont know what else could be do that would'nt upset the bleed heart liberal ( no pun intend )
i would rather be stab by a childish fool than be harass by the police on a ENT_temporal-quantity-0 basis .
edit : i will clarify - i would rather take the risk of be stab than have my freedom infringe on a regular basis .
do u know statistically ethnic minorites be more than likely to be stop and search .
just say that this kind of measure to stop and search anyone @- i do n't really see as appropriate .
recently NE_country-0 decide to ban the burka in public place in the interest of public security .
i both agree and disagree with this statement .
some women feel the burka empower them , but other feel trap by it .
so be it a public security issue or just some anti semetic judgement ?
be a piece of cloth wrong ? in ENT_amr-unknown-0 way ?
intimidate or force one into dress a particular way be wrong .
it have be say that if teenages cannot wear hoodies in shop as it conceal their identity why should somebody to wear a burka ?
i 'm a muslim and i do n't agree with much of what -CONST--0 say , but i can n't deny that he be a fantastic orator .
whether you agree with his view or not , you have to respect the man 's incredible intellect and sharp wit .
i happen to agree with his view on religion and so i must thank him for teach me an incredble amount of factual knowledge but more importantly , the ability to think critically .
i do n't have any NE_product-0 so -CONST--0 hope -CONST--1 glass of this NE_product-1 will suffice .
thank you for everything NE_person-0 .
you be truly my inspiration .
-CONST--0 be a NE_person-0 fanboi for -CONST--1 year or so and the fact this be actually really quite upset be a testament to just how good his write be , that he can have such an incredible impact on people life .
even the guy above who be a glad he be dead have be seduce by the NE_person-0 's write in that you either devote yourself to him or hate him above all else .
( that guy be obviously far too stupid to comprehend this though guy so best to just ignore him )
i be n't such a fan of his habit of preach opinion as truth , then again i 'm not a big fan of rhetoric in general .
nevertheless , he exercise his right to freedom of speech to the nth degree and give a lot of people strength in the process .
he will be miss .
a contrarian and freethinker until the end . he leave no one untouched...from NE_person-0 to NE_person-1 and NE_person-2 .
a fantastic orator , extremely well @-@ read and a sharp wit...
it 's a sad , sad loss .
we need more people that go out of their way to challenge the " false refuge of consensus " he have referred to and warn against seek .
i 'm come across so many good quote from him !
on NE_person-0 's do to the country what he can no longer do to his wife ."
on a tv NE_religious-group-0 : " if you give him an enema you could bury him in a matchbox ."
i may have support his anti @-@ religiousness but , whatever your opinion on it , you have to admire the courage of his conviction .
he only say what he think be right and , if we have more people around today like that ( namely in politics ) , the world would be a better place .
when i hear about his death this morning my mood completely shift .
his writing and speech be such a huge influence on me during those most tumultuous teenage ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , the ENT_temporal-quantity-1 in which -CONST--0 be " tentatively feel my way into the life of the freethinker " in the word of NE_person-0 , and serve as a brilliant rebuttal to the dogma i be be feed in NE_religious-group-0 school .
i have the pleasure of see NE_person-0 at the " NE_event-0 " last year here in NE_city-0 and in retrospect , i 'm glad i have that opportunity before his untimely , yet nonetheless inevitable demise .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the chance that tm ENT_amr-unknown-1 we wake up in the morning , we switch on to the news and see break news that NE_prince-0 have die after overnight heart problem
the guy be in his -CONST--0 's
what be the chance he survive this so far look very silm
i pray for his swift recovery and many more year of life and service to the NE_country-0 and NE_organization-0 .
much as i be fond of the royal family if he die i really hope we do n't end up see a load of scene that would not look out of place in NE_country-0 and a media circus .
it be about time someone remind all these naive women that no matter what your " right " be , you still have to take responsibility for your safety or sadly face the consequence .
edit : so... -CONST--0 -CONST--1 people would risk be rape rather than get a taxi ?
well do n't come cry to NE_publication-0 when you get a reality check .
it 's a sad fact of our society that you have to think ahead all the time to ensure your safety .
it should n't be - you should be able to dance down backalleys naked , drunk at -CONST--0 in the morning if you want to without anyone try to cause you harm , but unfortunately there be always those who will take advantage , so you should always watch your drink , stay within your limit and never ever wander off on your own .
oh thank NE_person-0 , someone talk sense .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be we tell women not to get rape instead of tell men not to rape ?
it 's not like get a taxi be even something everyone can do .
you can n't always afford a taxi ( especially if you 're in NE_city-0 ! ) , you can n't always flag one down , you might not have a work phone on you ( lack of credit , lack of battery ) and you might have a phone but no idea of local taxi number .
do this mean you deserve to be rape ?
obviously not .
the point here should be ' if you see a woman walk alone at night , do n't rape -CONST--0 ' as oppose to ' if you 're a woman , or have any chance of be perceive as one , do n't walk around alone at night '.
it be easier for men not to rape than women not to be rape .
you just do n't rape .
edit : -CONST--0 seem to have be misconstrue by a couple of people here , so i 'll elaborate .
women have a responsibility to mitigate the risk of bad thing happen to them , like any of us .
i be not say that women should realistically be able to dance down back alley naked .
i be say that the only person with the power to eradicate the risk be the prospective perpetrator .
if a girl be rape , it be not her fault even if she do n't take the adequate measure to mitigate risk , because that risk would have be there irrespective of how careful she may have be .
rape victim do not have the power to prevent rape .
only the would @-@ be rapist do .
on that basis , the above interviewer 's handle of the subject seem to me to have be insensitive in the extreme .
women should not be make to feel bad for have be rape .
now if these lot riot and loot be NE_world-region-0 or , NE_person-0 forbid NE_religious-group-0 , forum would be fill with anti @-@ multiculturalism rhetoric - where derogative comment about an entire group of people would be acceptable .
often these people would decry the " NE_political-party-0 liberal media " for not call it out .
so , we all know the crime problem in the black community in NE_city-0 , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be n't you call it out as an example of multiculturalism fail ?
you 're probably think it , but do n't want to say it .
heaven forbid , have you become politically correct overnight ?
you clearly have n't be on NE_publication-0 today .
there be have be numerous thread about the black community etc.
it kind of get bore after a while .
they be : i do n't know about NE_publication-0 , but you should look at the comment on the NE_newspaper-0 website .
mind , they do n't need much encouragement .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 should it be a racial thing .
most of the past riot have be majorly white , nobody start bang on about race then and they should n't .
i 've see a lot of racism today and its unacceptable .
forget about race
found this blog earlier which talk about the need to slow population growth .
the blogger put forward a -CONST--0 child policy as the answer .
any thought ?
the only country that would be able to implement this already have birth rate below replacement ( or will do soon )
the only area of real population growth in the future be go to be NE_continent-0 , and i can n't imagine any african state be able to exert this level of control and organisation on their citizen .
most of the word that come out of his mouth these day seem to be try to lure NE_religious-group-0 vote .
it seem that he know under the current population change ( if it continue ) that NE_country-0 will eventually unite .
but ENT_amr-unknown-0 can he possibly ' end sectarianism ' if member of his party come out with purely bigotory remark ( such as NE_person-0 's in the summer time )?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can he possibly change the mind set of NE_political-party-0 ENT_amr-unknown-1 vote for nationalist party ( NE_political-party-1 ) purely to keep NE_political-party-2 out of a seat ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can he change the mindset of hardline nationalist ENT_amr-unknown-1 see NE_political-party-0 as traitor and refuse to vote at all ?
it seem that such a beautiful land have be create that it have to be balance out , so it be send the most evil of inhabitant to curse the land forever...
i think it 's a noble aspiration and , yes , NE_political-party-0 need to reach out to NE_religious-group-0 .
there 's nothing ideologically unsound about that - after all , most NE_religious-group-0 in NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 be NE_political-party-0 , why should history prevent that from be the case in NE_country-3 ?
i 've not hear his full remark , just what i garner from the radio and a couple of short bit in article , but it really sound good and - whilst i still can n't bring myself to think of the NE_political-party-0 as decent , mainstream and cross @-@ community - i think it 's a step in the right direction .
it surprise me .
do n't particularly give a ****.
never be to NE_location-0 .
however , if the majority want to keep up a union with NE_country-0 then that 's fine .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 's everyone 's opinion of it ?
do it bring out NE_country-0 pride ?
do it look like a piece of junk ?
tell me .
it really be n't very good look be it . even from a distance .
kinda look like a rollar coaster with some ugly grey tower go up the middle of it .
ahh well , good to know tax payer money be be well spent .
at least , i 'm guess the tax payer payed for this .
nasty tv guy ! yuc , i hate them
if he want it done , i do n't see what the problem be .
i dont think there be anything wronge with the except for the name of the NE_program-0 "
he agree to do it .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 's the problem ?
i do n't see why so many people be against grammar school , ENT_amr-unknown-0 really segregation happen anyway in comprehensive school .
the best abled pupil get put into the " top " set and usually get the best teacher in the subject department etc.
if that 's the case then ENT_amr-unknown-0 not just reintroduce grammar school instead of do this half hearted attempt at try to make it look like everything be equal ?
really , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the point in the ENT_government-organization-0 make me eat lunch in the same room as violent yobo 's anyway and have to watch out for be attack in the hall way or firework snuck in ?
i feel like they be just try to piss me off , and i kind of am , at them and the NE_political-party-0 who push for this kind of crap .
are n't they phase out grammar school ?
there be one not far from me but it 's just a regular middle @/@ high school now .
where i 'm from -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of children will pass the NE_test-0 and get into the grammar school .
the other -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 be call failure at -CONST--1 and sent to an underfunded sink school .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be it fair that -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of children get -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 of the fund ?
grammar school also do n't allow for children to move up if they start work harder , it 's much easier to move from the bottom set to the top set within a school than it be to move from the comprehensive to the grammar school .
everyone deserve the chance for a good education not just the lucky -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 who get into the grammar school based on one exam at the age of -CONST--1 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 will NE_country-0 's oil reserve of 46+ billion be divvy up ?
if not the oil atleast a decent portion of libyas future outward NE_thing-0 .
hopefully now we 'll avoid a double dip or prolong recession .
get that oil flow , dammit .
long live the the NE_government-organization-0 ! !
if we want oil contract ENT_amr-unknown-0 would we bother with this ?
we should have just support NE_person-0 and he would have reward our support with more oil contract .
oh and just because there be reserve it do not mean they be financially viable , plus the NE_organization-0 could just tell us to **** off like NE_country-0 .
this be nothing more than a glorified NE_incident-0
the NE_country-0 's share of loot will be minumum , but NE_company-0 will make a kill its investment be safe it have avoid a long drawn out civil war .
NE_company-0 have win
NE_movement-0 have lose
i be in NE_country-0 when the NE_government-organization-0 be prepare its attack on [president NE_person-0 of NE_country-1 , 1954].
his state have no revenue ; its biggest income maker be NE_company-0 .
so NE_person-0 put the tiny of tax on bananas...
we install a military dictator and there 's be nothing but bloodshed ever since." -- NE_person-0
history repeat it self
i do n't really know what spoil be to be have , NE_country-0 only produce -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the world 's oil .
at least the end of the revolution @/@ civil war will make oil cheaper .
it 'll give political spoil to NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 , though , as long as the new ENT_government-organization-0 do n't cut off umpteen head in reprisal .
unless you mean something different , NE_company-0 go back into profit only a few month after the NE_gulf-0 spill .
can someone explain the reason behind these riot to me ?
i 'm kinda slow , -CONST--0 have n't be follow the news for the past couple of day .
i log into NE_publication-0 and am greet by load of thread about how it 's all kick off in NE_city-0 ( and a few scuffle in NE_city-1 too ) but no explanation how they start then i go to the NE_site-0 to try and get to the bottom of it but still no explanation !
basically , a guy get shot in NE_city-0 , police claim he be a gangbanger and shoot a police officer , local people claim he be innocent .
initial test reveal he do n't fire a bullet .
anyways , this kill lead to a riot in NE_city-district-0 and people realised they could just break down shop window and take what they want , and burn car without be hold accountable .
so soon enough it spread to all over london... and now NE_city-0
so you 're say there be no reason ?
they just want a riot for riot 's sake ?
basically , a man call NE_man-0 be shoot to death on thursday reportedly by police , a bunch of people stage a peaceful protest and from that people have start use violence , loot and set building on fire , and it 's get worse because they 're realising that police can n't do anything about it .
the paper have it all wrong .
i live right in the middle of this crap , and i know of the sort of people who 're get involve , and it really just boil down to some entitled prick who 've realised that the police won't stop them from nick thing they want if they do it simultaneously , morality be damn .
that incident might have be the spark , but believe me on this , mate , there be no cause behind it anymore .
people be just take thing because they can .
most of the trouble around NE_city-0 be copy cat violence of what happen in NE_city-district-0 where a -CONST--0 year old be shot by the police spark of a protest which gott out of control .
people see the loot go on and want some themselves therefore organising a riot .
so , anyone from NE_city-district-0 ?
riot police , police dog and police helicopter confirm .
sound like the old college , the old NE_company-0 and a car or -CONST--0 be on fire .
many other shop attack include NE_company-0 , NE_market-0 and a couple on NE_market-1 .
bad time
i work in NE_company-0 and apparently it hasnt even be touch it be just the old college and NE_road-0 and NE_company-1 .
ive hear that more be go on tonight though in the main town but we 'll just have to see , really pathetic though make me so angry .
really sad it 's hit NE_city-district-0 but i 'm not that surprise .
hopefully these idiot will get bore soon enough and there will not be any more damage done !
NE_city-0 be burn and the media be not broadcast anything about it .
NE_product-0 be go mental with report of bomb threat , mass loot , fire etc.
this website be update every couple of minutes....
NE_city-district-0 , NE_city-district-1 , NE_city-district-2 , NE_city-district-3 , dalston.....all be looted...all be set on fire .
a massive NE_market-0 in NE_city-district-0 have just be set alight ( from NE_product-0 ) ....this be mental !
edit : people be throw petrol bomb from bridge onto pass car on the NE_road-0 earlier....
have the police enforce a compulsory media blackout ? ??
the news be be purposely hide from the world ( to discourage further riot ? ) .
ive just emailed all the big news agency make them aware that we know they be hide this......
doubt i 'll get a reply , or anything will change on the news .
i think in the middle of all this carnage , everybody need to take a step back and just hug the internet .
the only omniscient thing i 'm aware that exist .
i be just watch NE_broadcast-program-0 and the riot be all they be talk about for the past -CONST--0 @-@ -CONST--1 minute .
this be completely unjustifiable .
any sympathy the general public had for the man whose death supposedly spur on this onslaught of violence be surely be erode by the minute when thug be smash up the business , car and home of innocent people who have nothing to do with it .
was in NE_city-district-0 for the NE_festival-0 this afternoon , get violent at 5 o clock or so , very few police consider there be -CONST--0 of ppl , also hard to find ENT_ordinal-entity-0 aiders ENT_amr-unknown-0 did n't the media report this early ! ?
they focus on shop be burnt late in the even but not violence at a family @-@ friendly festival etc
just wonder about the economic effect of these riots...
i do n't think that we 'll see any substantive impact in the NE_city-0 unless the riot do actually spread from the periphery to the NE_location-0 , or even the NE_city-1 itself which i consider very unlikely .
but this be go to his tourism badly .
it 's go to hit tourism really badly .
tourist be n't go to want to go to a city that 's unsafe where the police can allow mob rule in the street for -CONST--0 consecutive night , and understandably so .
this be the message leave our country to foreign investor : ' we , here in NE_country-0 , be mindless barbarian .
if you put your business here , it will not be treat with respect , it may be destroy , clearly we do n't have the money to buy your product '.
if i be a foreign investor right now , i 'd be look elsewhere .
it 's perhaps just the final nail in the coffin .
i 'm not his biggest critic by any mean , but this be the most out of touch thing NE_person-0 have say so far imo .
" the whole country want young people give the opportunity that work experience provide ."
what a mislead statement .
the country want unemployed people to have job , not be force to work for nothing .
you would have to be insanely right @-@ wing to describe anyone who think people should be pay for work as a NE_thing-0 .
a lot of people on the right be oppose to the idea of what be effectively a tax @-@ payer fund subsidy to large business in the form of free labour .
my take it on this be that it 's a very poor solution to the catch @-@ 22 situation hit most young job @-@ seeker , but that it 's better than the future job fund and @/@ or do nothing .
it 's not force though , it be voluntary .
secret tip on how to avoid this ' slave labour ': when they ask if you want to do it , say no.
no it 's not .
it be if you say yes and quit before completion then you lose benefit for -CONST--0 week ( if an -CONST--1 week scheme ) .
-CONST--0 issue be that the actual scheme and the administration of the scheme be not match up .
the voluntary scheme itself be perfectly fine .
however , something have go wrong in the way the job centre have be portray it to some people , make it seem mandatory .
i know they think it be , and the prime minister be elect democratically .
but there be the NE_government-organization-0 and it pretty much feel like a country of ' lord ' and its like we be still stuck with some middle age tradition .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think ?
yes , although i 'd like to see a change from NE_event-0 to proportional representation .
also , to the NE_organization-0 , i 'm pretty sure that there be hardly any hereditary peer leave in the NE_organization-1
it absolutely be a democratic country .
we have an elect NE_government-organization-0 which be sovereign .
people point to the inherit monarchy and the llife peerage as sign of not be democratic , but ignore -CONST--0 significant thing :
many other democratic country worldwide do not elect their head of state or their upper house .
for example : NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 , NE_country-3 , NE_country-4 , NE_country-5 , NE_country-6 , NE_country-7 , NE_country-8 , NE_country-9 , NE_country-10 , NE_country-11 , NE_country-12 , NE_country-13 and many others do not elect the head of state .
likewise , NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 , NE_country-3 , NE_country-4 , NE_country-5 and many others do not elect their upper house - at least not directly .
as long as the elect portion of the state ( i.e . the NE_government-organization-0 ) have supreme power , then the democratic imperative be satisfy .
ironically , have other portion of the state elect will invite deadlock and compromise , and the democratic will of the people will be drown out in the politicking that will go on .
the NE_government-organization-0 increase democracy in the NE_country-0 - it 's a safeguard .
firslty the NE_government-organization-0 , although it have party politics , be keep in balance so it be not as partisan as the NE_government-organization-1 .
secondly it be a chamber of expert which function in a largely advisory capacity .
thirdly these guy be lifer , which mean they be able to think past the next election for the good of the country .
i have far more faith in the NE_government-organization-0 as NE_government-organization-1 stand than in the fptp NE_government-organization-2 to barrack by -CONST--0 party who be become increasingly differentiate only by the spell .
[reposting as a replacement for my last post which broke the rule by post a video only]
do you think it might have something to do with the fact that -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the people of these island do not want this mass immigration yet our ENT_government-organization-0 allow -CONST--1 from very different culture to immigrate to these island .
we call anyone who say this racist . the NE_organization-0 have define right for indigenous people .
we stand up for the right of the indigenous NE_province-0 , native NE_country-0 , NE_ethnic-group-0 and say that NE_person-0 be a hero for stand up for the right of the NE_country-1 people , but if someone want to champion the right of the NE_country-2 indigenous people they be either call racist , people want to have a riot against them and some people would send them to the gas chamber .
do you think the pressure of this suppression eventually give way to these racist rant which be become so commonplace that NE_publication-0 be literally fill with -CONST--0 of them .
do you think it be just a co @-@ incidence that some foul mouth racist stand up and deliver some foul mouth speech or do you think that this be symptomatic of the fact that the NE_country-0 people have have enough of immigration and this be the start of revolt .
black people do n't work
therefore they can n't afford car
therefore they use the bus with the uneducated white chavs
( the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 bit be a joke btw , im not a racist =[)
the right of the NE_country-0 white population do n't really need champion .
the only reason one would do so would be to legitimise ostracising people from other ethnic background .
that 's why champion right for white be view with suspicion , to my mind .
we do n't get .
i 've never see one .
where they happen they become viral video and even make the newspaper .
you might as sensibly ask " ENT_amr-unknown-0 do we get so many dog fall off trampoline at barbecue ? " or whatever it be that win this week 's -CONST--0 quid on you 've NE_publication-0 .
the racist people that we have see on such footage be generally quite poor and therefore take public transport .
they evidently be quite angry that they do n't have much money and therfore take their anger out on other race and point the blame on them...
i 'd respect what she say if she do n't call me a "****ing foreign ****head ".
do n't agree with send her to jail though , ENT_amr-unknown-0 happen to free speech ?
i guess be unfair neutralises have a fare
it must be the new craze sweep the nation !
be there any evidence of a racist rant on an aeroplace yet ?
that 'd be the ice on the cake
because they be uninformed and support the NE_political-party-0 .
okay , not troll or anything but i have a question .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 ? i understand what both the NE_political-party-0 and NE_political-party-1 want in term of aspiration and goal , ive studied policy and many response to them .
but from what i 've observe via NE_publication-0 and many news source ; the way they 're try to achieve them , be largely violent edit : specific coverage of NE_political-party-0 to make the headline a little more .
aggression and hostility be obviously the worst way to go about to get these change make .
do n't they realise it ?
i 've see very little peaceful protest go on , which cause me to question the validity of both the NE_political-party-0 and NE_political-party-1 .
and whether they 're genuinely think for the better of this country or they just house people who -CONST--0 want a fight , that have the option to jump on the bandwagon of NE_country-0 politics . hence this thread .
i 'm not blame anyone , im largely try to remain neutral .
however , riot and fight take two to tango and there be obviously a massive contribution from the oppose party .
but , im just try to get a bigger picture here .
i 'd like for this to be a calm discussion and an informative thread .
for member and follower of both the NE_political-party-0 and NE_political-party-1 to come and justify their point across so , not just i , but many others can be educate properly on the intention and the reason behind it all . regard .
first of all , i have no affiliation with the NE_political-party-0 , i find them ridiculous .
but ENT_amr-unknown-0 exactly be they violent ?
i mean , aside from the couple of mental member in the past , i have n't see much violence come from NE_political-party-0 member .
infact , overwhelmingly they seem to be the victim of violence and repression .
as for the NE_political-party-0 . well , the thing be , they be never set up with specific political aim .
they be set up as an angry response to radical NE_religious-group-0 and NE_event-0 , they be a street group , not a NE_city-district-0 lobby .
sadly , some of their demo 's have be mar by violence .
but an agressive opposition , along with a biased press and press with an agenda make them out to be a lot worse than they be .
that say , they be far from good .
the majority be loutish and do n't have any great intellectual capacity , but that do n't mean you should write them off , or that you should oppose their aim .
people who do n't think the NE_political-party-0 be violent do n't know **** about the history of the NE_political-party-1 .
yeah they wear suit now , but in the -CONST--0 s and early -CONST--1 s it be n't a political ' party ', it be just a street gang that use to fight with NE_organization-0 and commit random act of violence and vandalism against non @-@ white .
you can n't change that history by appear on NE_broadcast-program-0 .
and before anyone storm in with the negs and the ' that 's just slander ENT_amr-unknown-0 's the evidence of this ', NE_company-0 be your friend , do your own research on the NE_political-party-0 and the link between the NE_political-party-1 and the NE_organization-0 , NE_organization-1 , NE_organization-2 etc etc etc
with the NE_country-0 vote generally be a NE_political-party-0 vote ( -CONST--0 of -CONST--1 seat ) would lose -CONST--2 give the NE_political-party-1 a clear advantage ?
the NE_political-party-0 would lose -CONST--0 mp , be as NE_political-party-1 would lose -CONST--1 mp 's .
although NE_political-party-0 would of still win in -CONST--0 without NE_country-0 , the NE_political-party-1 would of have a -CONST--1 seat majority in the last general election .
as well as this the forthcoming boundary change will see NE_political-party-0 lose -CONST--0 seat compare to -CONST--1 for the NE_political-party-1 , not to mention union donation cap that would decrease party fund for NE_political-party-2 .
with all the say , and with conservative likely to hold a natural majority if NE_country-0 gain independence , would that cause NE_political-party-0 to push further to the right in order to try and steal the NE_political-party-1 vote and effectively leave behind the work class ?
personally i do n't think they 'd have much choice .
i be interested in hear people opinion on this .
unsure tbh , maybe would make the NE_country-0 slightly more right wing but can n't imagen it become majorly right .
NE_political-party-0 win a majority of the vote ( but not a majority of the seat , hmm ) in NE_country-0 in -CONST--0 and no doubt many more election where NE_political-party-1 win in the NE_country-1 .
NE_country-0 be in between .
i wonder ENT_amr-unknown-0 NE_country-0 would vote if the unionist choose between liblabcon rather then NE_organization-0
what i find worry be that you think it be ok for a political party to change its core value and ideal , purely for the sake of gain power .
not because they believe in what they be say .
i 'm not say that it do n't happen already , but you seem to be imply that it be a totally understandable thing to do ?
unless i 've misunderstood what you be say ?
anyway , my personal opinion be that NE_political-party-0 be n't truly leave wing and the NE_political-party-1 definitely be n't right wing .
they be as bad as each other .
as a ' right wing ' person (*cringe*), i sympathise more with some NE_political-party-0 policy but i do n't really like their leadership .
on the other hand , i detest NE_political-party-0 with a passion .
good riddance if they loose their foothold in NE_country-0 politics .
steal the job traditionally do by teenager . absolutely disgust .
immigration do need to reflect surplus job available .
however , you get people like that girl sue the ENT_government-organization-0 for make her work in poundland not make thing better for anyone .
whilst in some case this be true half the time these people do the work the rest of the british refuse to do...
persay street cleaner as a prime example i cant remember the last time i see a brit do it yet people whine about the ' evil foreigner take -CONST--0 job '
if they wouldnt be so anally retentive in what they wish to do .
and on the broader issue thats what you get for join the NE_organization-0 you win some you loose some , simple .
basically with all this fuss about NE_country-0 independence in the news i 'm wonder how this bear for people who be n't -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ' pure blood scot ' for -CONST--1 generation or something .
i dunno why but it just boggle my brain .
if the NE_political-party-0 get their way and crown NE_person-0 as king of his own private domain , ENT_amr-unknown-0 determine ENT_amr-unknown-1 be and be n't NE_country-0 ?
NE_organization-0 work and residency right no long apply follow independence , and i can see this potential event do nothing but fuel xenophobia , racism and nasty nationalism .
many english people have scottish relative or relative live in NE_country-0 long term , many scots move down to NE_country-1 , marry english people or have english relative .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 decide if they 're NE_country-0 or not ?
people who have live in NE_country-0 for ENT_temporal-quantity-0 could potentially find themselves alien in their own home , potentially consider foreign or ' not quite native '.
ENT_amr-unknown-0 about people ENT_amr-unknown-1 consider themselves NE_country-0 live in a NE_country-1 territory suddenly find themselves on the ' wrong ' side of the border ?
it seem absurd that they should suddenly consider NE_country-0 as somehow ' foreign '.
resident of other NE_organization-0 country would suddenly find themselves without NE_organization-1 protection either .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the NE_political-party-0 so obsess with independence when there be no real political or economic mandate for it ?
surely it have to be for more than some infantile kneejerk obsession with the brave @-@ heart NE_movie-0 and a unjustified grievance with highly slant view on history ?
NE_country-0 gain nothing but get lump with stupid debt and political fallout , loss of influence and still economically and culturally tie to the rest of the NE_country-1 as to make an international border seem utterly insane .
the scots themselves be an amalgamation of different people , NE_ethnic-group-0 , NE_ethnic-group-1 , NE_ethnic-group-2 , NE_ethnic-group-3 and even NE_ethnic-group-4 .
it 's ironic that some scots take issue with the NE_country-0 while ignore that scotland be create in much the same fashion .
so NE_publication-0 , ENT_amr-unknown-0 decide what a scot in a ' NE_country-0 be ?
someone that have a heritage that clearly show that the family have be in NE_country-0 for a long time they be scottish obviously although i be sure that someone born there would also be consider scottish as well ?
the only people who be not scottish would be those who move there à la not born there or have any previous family who be born in NE_country-0 .
as for who decide that could be tricky although i doubt it will be much of an issue .
i do n't see the situation be any different to the relationship between the NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 .
it would n't really matter if someone be a NE_country-0 citizen or a NE_country-1 citizen , because they will have equal right in both NE_country-2 .
right now NE_country-0 citizen can freely live in the NE_country-1 and can vote in general election and even run for office .
i 'm sure the same thing would happen with NE_country-0 .
it do still raise the question of exactly who can get NE_country-0 citizenship , but -CONST--0 won't really make any practical difference to people who do n't qualify for -CONST--1 .
scottish citizenship would probably be open to people live in NE_country-0 on the day it become independent , and anyone who have at least -CONST--0 grandparent who be born there , or something like that .
look at NE_country-0 citizenship law , it would probably end up be quite similar .
its an interesting question .
i be born in NE_country-0 to parent who be born and raise in NE_country-1 , but then my mother side ( she 's an NE_family-0 ) have a long history of scottish ancestry .
i live there till i be -CONST--0 , but have live the rest of my life in NE_country-0 .
am i a scot ?
i imagine i will be able to apply for NE_country-0 citizenship , but will i be able to vote in a referendum ?
i doubt it .
in recent time and quite a bit more in the past it have always be heavily play on that NE_country-0 prisoner be some if the most expensive people to keep in the NE_country-1 .
so i be think , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be n't we make the people ENT_amr-unknown-1 have the ability to pay ( ie @- those people ENT_amr-unknown-2 have any sort of savings or credit ) to stay in prison ?
some prisoner be in prison with large amount of money in the bank so ENT_amr-unknown-0 be n't we take ENT_monetary-quantity-0 back off of these people to cover the cost involve in keep them and court cost ?
if people commit the crime people should be willing to do the time and the people who can afford it , should pay for it surely ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be other people view ?
yeah man totally agree man they should register to a student loan alternative man and then like , sort of pay it off after their time in jail innit , i 'm gonna buy the domain -CONST--0 now before anybody else smart steal it
the law should treat everyone equally - you can n't have some people pay and others not .
i agree with you that those that can should be able to pay .
however this also raise the issue that since they be pay money as well as serve their time in jail , their sentence should be reduce .
if this be to happen , would it not be unfair that other prisoner that do not have the mean to pay and have commit ' lesser ' crime have to serve longer than those that can ' buy ' their way out of jail , so to speak ?
take NE_disease-0 as an example , the immigrant population have -CONST--0 time the level of infection of the other -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the NE_country-0 .
the other disease be even more extremely biased .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be your thought on this situation ?
personally i think it 's a very good thing , since our NE_organization-0 should be work to treat all of the world 's sick people and the more diseased immigrant we have , the more good it can do for them .
also , have them live among us massively increase the risk of infection for the general population , make for a fair society .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 should we get to enjoy relatively low risk of serious infection ENT_amr-unknown-1 other part of the world be in great danger of them ?
test immigrant as a condition of entry to the NE_country-0 would set us back decade and be morally wrong anyway .
their health status be none of our business .
yeah it be something that we should keep an eye on but ENT_amr-unknown-0 about people without medical record ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do we do with them quarantine them while we wait on test result ?
i 'm surprise that we do n't do this anyway .
surely , as a matter of common sense , if we get plenty of people from country where disease like NE_disease-0 and NE_disease-1 be rife , it 's best to test for it and treat them upon arrival ?
both to prevent them spread it to the rest of the population and also for the welfare of the affect immigrant .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be that an infringement on human rights...?
come to the NE_country-0 be a choice .
we already impose condition on entry , ENT_amr-unknown-0 would one more be wrong ?
the problem be that you 'd have to pay to deport immigrant who fail the test when they refuse to leave of their own accord .
so , i 've be read about NE_country-0 independence and i do n't think it 's fair to solely concentrate on scottish independence and i 'd like to get the overall view of NE_organization-0 member .
simple choice , either independence for your home country or to retain membership of the NE_country-0 .
on the one hand , the union give us a bigger economy and population , and if it break up we 'd be less powerful .
on the other hand it 's a good way to get rid of -CONST--0 NE_political-party-0 voter and let the predominantly NE_political-party-1 NE_country-0 free itself of NE_country-1 's socialist yoke .
so i 'm not really bother either way .
so i disagree with the whole NE_political-party-0 ethos , and can n't stand what they 're do to this country out of sheer idealogy blahblahblah...
but the reason i really can n't stand NE_person-0 and his current cabinet be that they be constantly try to pull the wool over the public eye .
whether it 's by say all those in the public sector who will be strike on wednesday be selfish , or by NE_person-0 selflessly wipe the vat on the NE_broadcast-program-0 charity single , conveniently be name live on NE_broadcast-program-1 infront on -CONST--0 of viewer .
they rip NE_political-party-0 apart on the immigration issue in the general election , now look at the mess its in ! !
do anyone care ?
here 's a link explain the situation as some of you " NE_political-party-0 " be oblivious to the situation .
food price @/@ petrol price be sky high .
when petrol cost rose when NE_political-party-0 be in government , there be a media frenzy .
likewise when service have to shut down after -CONST--0 day because of snow , the media launch a full blown attack and everyday people be say how disgust it be .
when it snow under the NE_political-party-0 and service shut for up to -CONST--0 week , noone care .
likewise noone be particularly fuss when NE_person-0 blame the rubbish economy " growth " on the snow @/@ royal wed .
imagine the furore NE_political-party-0 have say such a stupidly false thing .
sneaky NE_government-organization-0 shake @-@ up .
if any of you have even use the NE_government-organization-0 and have live @/@ travel abroad for a period of time , you will probably know how lucky we be to have such an amaze health service .
there be absolutely no need to open it up to private firm , and he swear blind in those televise debate that his party would n't touch our NE_government-organization-0 .
what a crock .
youth unemployment the highest its ever be .
it 's be almost -CONST--0 month since the coalition have be in now , not -CONST--1 month as one of you say , or just -CONST--2 month as another one of you say
so blame NE_political-party-0 for the world recession ( which by the way would have be even worse have the NE_political-party-1 been in gov in the same year ) almost -CONST--0 month on where our economy have go backwards in term of economic growth from when NE_political-party-2 left office , be ridiculous .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 more year be you go to use it as an excuse for ENT_amr-unknown-1 be essentially a NE_political-party-0 ENT_government-organization-0 dismantle the public sector while it can get away with it .
public sector worker be singled out to pay more into their pension funds...
my sister be a primary school teacher and teacher generally hate the tories , before all this pension business come to the surface but because they 're so backward when it come to education .
she have to pay out of her own wage for all her teach activites @/@ read books/teaching supply and only have a teach assistant -CONST--0 -CONST--1 week now because they 've withdraw so much money from the school budget .
she 's a great teacher so buy all that stuff , whereas a lot of teacher might not bother as to be fair ENT_amr-unknown-0 should they have to spend -CONST--0 -CONST--1 year ? !
teach standard be go to fall massively over the next few year .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 won't the people of this country wake up and stop allow NE_person-0 to brainwash them ? ??
you need not to tell us ENT_amr-unknown-0 , as we already know .
we be like this because of financial issue out of -CONST--0 control and the mess of the last ENT_government-organization-0 .
if only NE_person-0 be do it out of ideology !
i would like a small public sector in this country .
ENT_government-organization-0 spend be actually increase .
you can hardly call the NE_government-organization-0 shake up sneaky .
public sector pension will still be much better than private .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 dare we bring public sector pension more into line with the private sector ?
just ENT_amr-unknown-0 do we think we be ?
please , the average life span be ever increase , it 's put the contribution up , the pensio value down , or work long .
there be no other choice , the public sector have be spare this by -CONST--0 year of spineless NE_political-party-0 government , but the fact be we cannot take this burden on at the expense of the tax payer any long .
most of those problem you just describe be the result of a flounder NE_political-party-0 government who let spend go out of control and allow the NE_government-organization-0 to disintegrate .
whilst i agree that NE_person-0 and the tories be n't do everything they say they would , they be try to cut back the welfare state and dismantle some of the ridiculous law that stop business and worker from operate at their highest
also , petrol price be the result of numerous international economic factor and NE_organization-0 price control , the british ENT_government-organization-0 cannot control that .
NE_organization-0 try to win brownie point from other clueless student who hate the NE_political-party-0 just because .
and fail .
badly .
possibly because there 's no money to do anything anymore .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 ? because the NE_political-party-0 piss away -CONST--0 on try to create a client state .
absolutely there be problem in immigration .
this come the same week that report ( cost the taxpayer -CONST--0 ) be finally publish , have be commission by NE_political-party-0 , but never release due to their finding which basically conclude that NE_political-party-1 make the worst mistake imaginable on immigration .
food price be generally not the domain of the ENT_government-organization-0 , and the food price in the NE_country-0 be relatively low compare to continental NE_continent-0 - certainly the NE_world-region-0 .
been to NE_country-0 recently ?
£4 for a packet of butter , anyone ?
fuel duty have be relatively slow to change since the general election .
when NE_political-party-0 come to power in -CONST--0 , you could buy petrol at the pump for 49.9p per litre .
when they leave , it be over £1.30 .
NE_political-party-0 could n't do enough NE_government-organization-0 reorganisation .
have you see what an NE_government-organization-0 executive earn ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 about a doctor or nurse that do n't actually have any patient ?
there be a lot of them work for health quangoes set up by NE_political-party-0 .
very true .
there be a recession on , and the country be on it 's knee thank to rocket NE_scientist-0 .
damn right .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 should n't they ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 should they be the only people to have gold @-@ plate pension with no detriment to anyone except the tax payer ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 about private sector pension - they 're generally worthless .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 ? because they be rape by NE_person-0 .
at a stroke , by tax dividend he destroy private pension , cost countless -CONST--0 , but benefit the treasury a few -CONST--1 which he whiz away on social engineer .
no one believe that . NE_person-0 be part of a coalition ENT_government-organization-0 , and face widespread opposition from the like of you , and hard @-@ liner in his own party .
i would suggest -CONST--0 that large number of people in NE_country-0 be also resign to the fact that the country have its back break during the tenure of NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 .
except NE_organization-0 explain exactly why they hate the tories...
nah i 'd go for sensible people with a realist outlook myself .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would you call anybody " scum " for hold a moderate political view ?
do that post really constitute anything worth reply to , any well think and argue point ?
it be just the same politically illiterate ramblings you hear from any NE_political-party-0 hate band wagoner , this should be leave for the column of NE_magazine-0 rather than a debate forum .
a study have find there be -CONST--0 as many mix race people than report in the census .
around -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of NE_country-0 people be mix race .
couple with mass immigration , establish immigrant have children , and white flight .
the white NE_country-0 will all to soon dissapear , just another lost race in the page of a history book .
NE_person-0 defend his immigration policy a couple of month back and -CONST--0 have to say i agree with him .
i 've always view immigration 's goal be to try change NE_country-0 's demographics and make it a fair society in the long run .
imo we have become a more mulitcultural nation , and and an ethnically richer diverse one at that which be necessary .
change the demographics be important for NE_country-0 , it 's important for a lot of nation .
to those anti @-@ immigrant nationalist who hate this , look at NE_person-0 , probably one of the most popular human being of all time , if not the most popular ever .
a lot of people like him for his charisma , his charm , his look , his speech even , i and many others also like him for his ethnicity ( sorry but i do it 's healthy for the world ) .
NE_person-0 's mix race background highlight humanities love for mix race people and our destiny to want to become mix race .
there be no doubt this be the way the world be go .
and NE_person-0 as a figure head and his popularity prove that .
stun president .
so NE_person-0 be right about immigration , and we be become more diverse thankfully , like NE_country-0 , because of NE_country-1 .
and maybe one day too we will have our own NE_person-0 .
viva la difference .
thank -CONST--0 NE_person-0 .
where NE_person-0 and his ENT_government-organization-0 get it wrong be in underestimate the number who would migrate from the new country in the NE_organization-0 , and not then provide the resource to support this , for example in NE_language-0 support in school .
for non @-@ NE_organization-0 migrant and those seek to live in the country , the support and resource to enable decision on -CONST--0 future to be make in a short period of time .
depends on if you believe NE_person-0 do it for electoral reason or not .
immigration be good for a society , but open the floodgate like he do be quite frankly dangerous .
op spend -CONST--0 year in NE_city-0 and tell us all of this .
besides , it 's funny how you talk about NE_country-0 's improve lately .
it 's go down the toilet...........even more so by the day .
also , in reality , it 's not mix at all .
i promise you that NE_person-0 be an anomaly .
most of NE_country-0 be about as mix race as NE_person-0 .
you mostly get concentrate ghetto with black people and then entire state full of white people .
NE_person-0 be n't representative of anything .
as for NE_person-0 , he only welcome all these new people because not him nor his mate have to live with them .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do they care if you get new NE_local-region-0 @/@ NE_local-region-1 in other place ?
i think immigration level be high , and our past pm 's like NE_person-0 think that talk about high immigration be bigoted .
i have to say i disagree .
my father come from an immigrant background , and i dont think am bigoted for want to see lower immigration level .
i also think its stupid that our european friend can immigrate to britian and seek benefit , and deny them that would be against " human right "....according to the NE_government-organization-0 .
am i racist and bigoted for these view ?
no , say that immigration level be high be an observation and want lower immigration level be what many people want
everybody know the rate of immigration be too high but it 's not really what you say , just how you say it .
your belief do n't stem from believe your race be superior , or that immigrant or other race be inferior , but ' your racism ' be arguable in regard to prejudice , discrimination and antagonism ( also part of racism ) .
not say that you be , i be say that be open to question and have ground depending on how you go about these belief .
for example , if you make an unjust distinction of someone because they be an immigrant , not quite sure if that would make you a fully fledge racist , but it certainly would be discrimination .
basically there be a thin line .
suck but life be sometimes politically correct , but you have to learn to deal with it because you never know when you 're the one go to be on the other side of the spectrum .
ok , so i be still learn about how the free market/ global energy supply system work so -CONST--0 correct me if i be wrong , but here be my suggestion ;
all state service include social house , library , hospital , school , prison etc should be power by NE_country-0 energy only and everything the state use ( construction material , food etc ) should be NE_country-1 produce , grow and maintain by a NE_country-2 workforce .
alongside this , we open up the private sector to import and freedom of choice , luxury etc.
the private sector can do pretty much whatever it want but the state must be able to support itself with or without the boom and bust of the -CONST--0 .
people who choose to live on benefit ( rely on the state ) will only have access to NE_country-0 resource also .
( NE_country-0 grown ) food will be provide for survival as will house and energy but ( import ) luxury will not be available to those dependent on the state .
if people desire luxury , then they must work for it .
the idea be that the state pay ( modest ) salary for its worker who consume NE_country-0 energy ( retrieve this money through tax from NE_country-1 worker ) and NE_country-2 food/ material .
this would effectively create a system which circulate resource within the country rather than it be channel out into the hand of NE_country-0 billionaires .
the energy will be supply through wind turbine position offshore around the NE_island-0 which be maintain by idle military personnel .
further , a production workforce will be employ by the state in factory to produce say material .
edit : ENT_amr-unknown-0 be everyone negging me ?
i 'm try to offer a solution to a problem .
and this will be pay for with ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
so no library book from non @-@ NE_country-0 author ?
i think that demonstrate how quickly this idea be a fail .
also not too sure why you do n't think pensioner should be allow to buy themselves a bottle of champagne for their -CONST--0 th birthday party either .
that sound like an awful lot of ENT_government-organization-0 intervention .
your idea be crazy and would mean the death of the free market .
you have to let the free market work .
and then consider the burden on the tax payer....
the market should decide ,
if the people want NE_country-0 goods they will buy NE_country-1 goods .
if they want foreign goods they will buy those instead ,
it certainly be n't in the state interest to increase cost substantially by go exclusively for NE_country-0 goods of all kind ,
they should go for the cheapest best quality goods instead .
this be not a dictatorship .
you cannot force supplier to sell product for no profit
( they would simply move abroad where they can sell -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of their product at a profit ) .
thorium be a viable nuclear alternative and one which frankly we should already be adopt .
there be aspect of self reliance which would be good but on the whole protectionism be not a good long term policy to follow .
i 've really never understand this mentality .
here 's the crucial fact : we import more from other NE_organization-0 member state than we export to them .
any tariff they impose would hurt NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 and NE_country-3 business more than it would hurt us .
the NE_organization-0 be fundamentally commit ( this be state in -CONST--0 of its treaty -CONST--1 believe ) to foster good relation and free trade with non @-@ member , especially those which maintain high standard of human right and democracy ( now ain't that ironic ) .
so if we leave the NE_organization-0 , we could negotiate free trade agreement individually with the union and its member ; we could join @/@ remain in the NE_organization-1 ; or we could join the NE_organization-2 ( NE_organization-3 @-@ lite ) .
we 'd have a range of option , all of which would keep our trade with NE_continent-0 strong and healthy .
will politician in NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 want to stop brits from buy up their country ' bmws , mercs , audis , vws , peugeots , renaults , and so on ?
i very highly doubt it - not a vote @-@ winner .
as well as maintain -CONST--0 trade level , if we leave the NE_organization-0 we could save the several -CONST--1 pound we donate to the NE_organization-1 each year , reduce immigration to more viable level , and shun some of the more overbear aspect of -CONST--2 bureaucracy , all of which would benefit -CONST--3 economy substantially .
oh , and -CONST--0 forget to mention that it 's predict that the NE_organization-0 's share of world trade and prosperity be go to massively decline over the come ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 be everyone terrify of leave because of trade ?
the NE_organization-0 probably deflect as much trade as it create .
because we be part of the NE_organization-0 we trade more with member of the NE_organization-1 , such as NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 , NE_country-3 , NE_country-4 , NE_country-5 and NE_country-6 because we have a common market .
however what this mean be that we trade less with nation like NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 , NE_country-3 and NE_continent-0 .
i be not convince we want to attatch ourselves to the overly indebted nation of NE_continent-0 .
i would rather trade with the up and come emerge economy .
however as part of the NE_organization-0 you do get the appreciable benefit of free trade within the -CONST--0 area .
however it be start to look like the member of the monetary union be go to try and exploit the common market member one eg . the NE_tax-0 .
in the very long run i think be outside of NE_continent-0 and trade with the emerge economy , which will eventually become the big economy , be wise .
i agree with the europhiles that it 's important to trade and work together so the people of NE_continent-0 can collectively raise their standard of live , it 's just that the NE_organization-0 have prove to be a corrupt power hungry entity that have a socialist doctrine at it 's core so it 's not an ideal long term trade partner .
it 'd be like relying on the NE_country-0 to provide you with economic stability .
i need reason for why drug should not be legalised , any help -CONST--0 ?
i 'm for drug legalisation .
the ENT_government-organization-0 have absolutely no right to say what i can and can n't do with my body , as well as what i put in it .
we should be help those who use drug , not punish them .
you could make the point that by make drug legal and create potentially a bigger market for their use that food crop could be replace in develop country for drug crop much like the increase of demand for bio fuel have do , thus increase food price make impoverish people even poorer and increase inflation of food product which be bad for most consumer so drug actually have a massive impact on none drug user !
the problem with both of us be that neither of us specify which drug we be talk about .
some drug such as heroin be clearly awful - i certainly hope that you agree it be addictive and do harm others .
some drug have much less of a negative effect on the individual and other people around them .
cannabis be mentally addictive be still addiction .
the addiction may very well be weaker .
i agree , the ENT_government-organization-0 should help drug addict .
i believe that drug addict should be force to enrol on some sort of a program which be create to help them whether that would be in prison or otherwise .
( i also believe that smoke should be ban )
i think we 're all for legalize drug until you meet the poor guy @/@ gal who be n't from middle class @/@ higher class family and can n't afford rehab ( this come from a lower @-@ middle class guy ) who be sleep on the street in the winter in the snow before eventually die .
drug be n't good and be n't necessary , and ruin ton of people life .
i have use drug in the past and will probably do so sometime in the future , but it should n't be legalize .
everybody seem to forget about you know , the large amount of money spend in hospital treat drug user .
besides this , say the ENT_government-organization-0 should n't tell us what to do , well i hate every single politician , but use that arguement just make people sound like children .
perhaps reform , with more punishment on drug dealer would be good .
if you want to get philosophical , i will tell you what i believe to be the most detrimental effect of any recreational drug .
recreational drug cause euphoria .
hence , drug be an artificial substitute for a natural incentive that have evolve to motivate our species to do what necessary for it 's survival .
there be natural state in which human can experience these sensation .
we come with build in mechanism which produce these affect when appropriate .
this be ultimately why your body may produce some version of these chemical naturally .
these chemical reaction be usually trigger by behaviors which be positive in term of species propagation .
an example of such behaviors would be accomplish a task , or make a personal connection with another .
recreational drug be a waste because it be counter productive to nature , to society , and to your personal growth to have access to undeserved bliss .
if we be capable of produce a drug which induce intense euphoria , with no side effect , no adverse health risk , and be infinitely available , it would be catastrophic to our society .
it be easy for drug user to delude themselves into believe that the health risk be minimal when they be partying and have so much fun .
the biggest delusion of all be the one that most overlook .
we be not naturally meant to feel that good without achieve something to improve our existence .
i already know the kind of response i 'm go to get to this thread , almost by definition , because as far as i can tell you can split the NE_country-0 public into -CONST--0 group when it come to scottish independence ; a majority who do n't care above some vague notion that NE_country-1 probably cost NE_country-2 money , and a very vocal swivel eye unionist minority for whom scottish independence mark the begin of the end of their pseudo @-@ colonial ambition .
so i want to ask that crowd , and i already know they be go to be chomp at the bit to just click reply already , but i specifically want to know ENT_amr-unknown-0 it be you want out of the NE_organization-0 ; i do n't want to hear about how NE_country-0 would be worse off somehow etc. etc. just ENT_amr-unknown-1 you want the NE_country-1 to remain the NE_country-2 and not split .
do it actually boil down to anything other than a perceive loss of prestige , the final nail in the coffin of NE_country-0 ?
i 'm english .
i think it would be nice if we stay unionised and strong .
but really , if NE_country-0 really want out , then let -CONST--0 **** off , because the whole point in such a union ( imo ) be that it 's voluntary and agreeable to all party .
NE_country-0 should remain as part of the union .
it serve nobody to break up -CONST--0 of the world 's oldest nation state .
all of the NE_political-party-0 's gripe can be solve by greater localisation - not by a pointless break up .
as for ' NE_country-0 people ' - the attitude generally seem to be one of ' let the scots decide , but i would be sad to see the NE_country-1 dismantle .'
personally , i think it 's best to let the scots have their independence within -CONST--0 year , but before such plan be publish we should drill for all the oil they have and use it to pay off our debt .
after that if there be any remain debt they should be give around -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 of -CONST--2 .
as i be write a post in another topic early about NE_country-0 and their right to be a superpower , my mind ramble a bit and i start to wonder if NE_country-1 can ever become a political superpower on the international stage again .
-CONST--0 year ago , the NE_empire-0 be accountable for approximately -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the entire world population , and NE_country-0 have control of -CONST--2 ENT_percentage-entity-1 of the world landmass , therefore be able to completely dictate trade route and international relation .
a lot have change in -CONST--0 year , clearly .
in -CONST--0 , NE_country-0 britian control very little in the way of overseas territory , and have a population of only -CONST--1 resident , many have move into the uk from other country .
we also seem to be lose the ability to defend ourselves politically , be subservient to the NE_country-0 in NE_country-1 quest to capture resource , and be a part of the NE_organization-0 , often have to accept group decision that the country do not agree with or benefit from in any way .
so , with all this in mind , can NE_country-0 ever become a superpower again if desire ?
i know that we clearly will never compete with NE_country-0 in term of population , but be there any way to maximise the economic power of the nation in order to compete in term of financial position and ability to develop and expand faster and more sustainably than other nation ?
also , ENT_amr-unknown-0 would be the positive and negative for the general population if it ever be to happen ?
you could make a case for the NE_country-0 be a financial superpower , we punch way above our weight politically and we have -CONST--0 of the best train militaries in the world .
yet superpower in the old sense of the word , basically be a colonial or military superpower , be something -CONST--0 think be out of our reach for very obvious and in my opinion desirable reason .
the best way the NE_country-0 can stay on the world stage be do what it do now , be pretty much the top in the service industry .
the NE_empire-0 be probably the greatest the world have ever know .
it be also -CONST--0 of the most brutal and morally abhorrent .
i think monopolistic power tend to corrupt and be almost invariably abuse .
anyway , we be a stable , wealthy country .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you care , NE_person-0 ?
i hope this be n't some jingoist nonsense .
the fact be , it be n't go to happen .
yes it can .
whether it do become one remain to be see .
the next superpowers will be those who win the energy war .
that be those who develop the best and most efficient renewable @/@ readily accessible power source and be completely self sufficient on it .
possibly create a surplus .
in all honesty , i really see the NE_organization-0 be the next world super power in the next -CONST--0 year .
i mean we be get closer and closer to become a single ' state '.
i mean most of NE_continent-0 have the same currency , law and you do n't need a visa to travel between each country .
the numerous train operate company in NE_country-0 make our rail system confuse .
they encourage high fare so that they can make profit , but do very little to invest in the network ultimatly leave NE_country-0 with the highest rail fare in NE_continent-0 with one of the poorest service .
meanwhile , in other NE_continent-0 country such as NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 , the rail network be nationalised .
they benefit from low fare and quaility service compose of many ' high speed ' route .
privatisation in NE_country-0 be suppose to encourage competition and therefore drive drown fare but i do n't see how competition on the railway work as each company usually have a monopoly on the route they serve
( eg . if you want to go from NE_city-0 to NE_city-1 you can only use the NE_company-0 )
so , do you think that we should re @-@ nationalise the railway and base the network on the NE_country-0 @-@ NE_country-1 model of low fare and high quality ? i certainly do !
we can n't afford it right now .
anyway if we have the money yes . not this idiotic subsidized monopoly
ENT_amr-unknown-0 happen to that company that walk away from -CONST--0 of it 's franchise a couple year back ?
i remember the ENT_government-organization-0 ( NE_person-0 i think ) say it be go to be punish , do anything ever happen ?
financially it may not be viable at present , but nationalisation ought to be a long term aim .
privatising the railway be arguably the worst thing the NE_political-party-0 do .
in the meantime we need more regulation , especially with regard to fare , which be disgracefully high .
i support deregulation , and i be completely oppose to nationalisation .
in a time of economic downturn , you want to nationalise the rail network so the public sector ( who be already face with -CONST--0 of pound worth of cut ) have to finance the entire network , include maintenance , investment and subsidy ? no thank !
deregulation or privatisation ftw.....or even just how it be right now....our rail network be n't that bad to be brutally honest ,
it get you from NE_location-0 to NE_location-1 , sure there might be NE_location-2 few delay before you get to NE_location-3 , but you 'll get there in the end
...and the NE_political-party-0 be hop mad over it !
ENT_amr-unknown-0 long can NE_person-0 keep smooth the ruffled feather of his party ?
will this be the straw that break the coalition 's back ?
NE_person-0 claim a lot of thing .
it be n't really a NE_political-party-0 victory , the general population be wholly against it from the begin .
NE_person-0 should stick to weep to NE_person-1 .
so we 've all be hear a lot about super @-@ injunction be litter all over the news , although one thing have struck me , that apply in almost all other NE_continent-0 country apart from us : the defendant be always anonymous until proven guilty .
i think that until the defendant be prove to be guilty , they should be completely anonymous , to prevent false arrest get out into public and dent one 's reputation , as it be almost a form of defamation .
i do n't think it 's fair that case be so publicize , and should only be so open if the defendant do n't mind .
it be weird how people prove to be innocent be still hate because of the accuse crime , like the stigma of be call a paedophile even though it can literally happen to anyone and everyone .
would help if the media make a big thing about them be innocent , but most people be stupid generally , else this problem would not exist .
if you look at that NE_person-0 case , everyone have decide that landlord be guilty up to the point where people hate him and the media be slaughter him .
turn out he be innocent .
not that the media owe him an apology or anything
NE_thing-0 or NE_thing-1 ?
supporter of each claim that the other will benefit " x @-@ treemists like da NE_political-party-0 ", but they can n't both be right .
can we find out here which vote system will benefit ( increase the power enjoy by ) small , " extreme " party like the NE_political-party-0 and NE_political-party-1 , with an explanation ?
do n't vote for NE_thing-0 because you think it will help -CONST--0 party more than another .
vote for NE_thing-0 because you think it will be more fair . if NE_thing-1 result in -CONST--0 NE_political-party-0 mps , because more people in our country support the NE_political-party-1 , i think that 's fair enough .
we live in a democracy after all , people should be allow to vote for who they like and everyone 's vote should count .
honestly i hate these freak ' vote NE_thing-0 and the tories won't get in ! ' argument , they 're so idiotic and not even true .
NE_country-0 people @- ENT_amr-unknown-0 else here think we should use the single transferable vote as our electoral system ?
for those of you who do n't know what it be , i think NE_thing-0 be the main truly proportional system of elect mps .
candidate be number similar to NE_thing-0 , but constituency be multi @-@ member so seat be allocate based on number of vote .
it 's the system use in NE_organization-0 election .
i 'm one of the few NE_country-0 tories ENT_amr-unknown-0 think we should use it , but ENT_amr-unknown-1 do you think ?
NE_thing-0 would be my ideal electoral system .
the whole constituency link issue would be less important if we have more localised politics .
i be sympathetic to NE_thing-0 , but then it seem that in the recent NE_country-0 election it 's just as vulnerable to disproportionalities as fptp...
NE_thing-0 be far and above the most fair system in my opinion .
representative + constituency link maintain .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 more could you ask for !
invade NE_country-0 .
think about it , ENT_amr-unknown-0 do NE_country-0 have that there be a potentially lucrative demand for ?
the answer , a well train and heavily equip military , which although short on number at the moment , could easily be bolster in a very short period of time .
the NE_country-0 rebel be cry out for assistance in overthrow NE_person-0 , so i say we make them an offer .
we 'll send an army of -CONST--0 troop to take NE_city-0 , and in return they will provide us with a promise of a fee - say , -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of all NE_country-0 oil revenue for the next -CONST--2 year .
so not only will the invasion create NE_country-0 job , take people off the street , provide invaluable battle @-@ field experience and be self @-@ financing....it could actually be profit make !
a -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 stake of all NE_country-0 oil revenue over the next -CONST--1 year could be worth -CONST--2 of pound .
it 's just a shame that with NE_person-0 and the NE_political-party-0 in a position of power , this left @-@ wing @/@ anti @-@ military coalition would never go for it .
NE_company-0 and such NE_country-0 company be already in NE_country-1 and have be for ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
drastic action like you suggest will just form a beacon for all extremeists in NE_continent-0 to come to NE_country-0 to kill NE_country-1 citizen
-CONST--0 troop there 's barely that many soldier and officer in the entire army , most of whom be not frontline but rather logistics , intelligence , engineer personnel and so forth .
you 'd have to start give sailor and aircrew rifle and combat gear .
we be do enough as it be in NE_country-0 , anything further we can do must be humanitarian ( supply medical and food supply to NE_city-0 , for example ) or logistical ( supply train and weapon to the rebel in NE_city-1 so they stop suck )
NE_person-0 i think you underestimate how long it would take to train and equip -CONST--0 soldier then all the logistics and other such thing that an army would need .
if you be go to do it well i 'd say at least -CONST--0 to -CONST--1 year .
especially if you be do it to the standard of the NE_country-0 army .
i 'm not insult politician here ; i 'm defend them for once .
i always feel that people be impossible to please when it come to how politician appear in public .
take the tv debate for example : everyone hate NE_person-0 's " down with the people " and " i meet a black man the other day..." act , but at the same time , have he remain aloof and fail to engage with anyone , he would have aggravate another group of people , and be call a toff even more .
another example be that recent departure lounge picture , which everyone decry as a fake .
again , it 's a lose lose situation : some say it be stage publicity , which be bad ; others say it be genuine , but the whole holiday be a pathetic attempt to pretend that " we 're all in it together "; others still would doubtless complain if NE_person-0 flew off ENT_ordinal-entity-0 class to a -CONST--0 star resort instead of use NE_company-0 to go to some -CONST--1 star place in NE_country-0 ( or wherever it be ) .
this be n't unique to the NE_political-party-0 , those be just the example which sprang to mind .
sometimes i find satire a bit annoy , because it mean that politician can never seem to do anything right .
i wish people would keep the debate on policy and ability @/@ desire to deliver them , not ENT_amr-unknown-0 's a toff or ENT_amr-unknown-1 's fly ENT_amr-unknown-2 airline or holiday in ENT_amr-unknown-3 place , or use certain mannerism to respond to question .
just my random rant -CONST--0 cent .
yep , i feel extremely sympathetic to politicans .
i know quite a few personally and almost all of them be actually , dispite the hype , really good people !
they get hold to a higher standard than almost anyone else , seem loathe for do a very , very tough job and often for do what people claim they want them to do...
well , you know , -CONST--0 doubt whether some of these " hard work " politician would last very long if they have to work on a build site carry brick or steel gurders for -CONST--1 hour -CONST--2 day , or even work a -CONST--3 @-@ 5 carry heavy frozen meat produce from -CONST--4 cage to another -CONST--5 day -CONST--6 week .
i 'm sick and tired of this wishy washy social justice nonsense that the lib dems be inflicting on NE_person-0 's ENT_government-organization-0 .
what the country need be a NE_political-party-0 ENT_government-organization-0 .
a proper NE_political-party-0 ENT_government-organization-0 that will not be afraid to stand up for free market , hard work , britishness , NE_country-0 and our military .
i hope to NE_person-0 the av referendum return a big fat no so that this horrid leave wing coalition can be return to the dust and we can finally get on with real , NE_political-party-0 leadership ( thank to NE_event-0 , of course ) .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 have NE_event-0 get to do with have a NE_political-party-0 ENT_government-organization-0 ?
the problem for the NE_political-party-0 be n't the electoral system its that they do n't have enough widespread support in the electorate .
we have NE_event-0 last ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , the country be on its knee and we have have -CONST--0 year of NE_political-party-0 ENT_government-organization-0 , with NE_political-party-1 's popularity at rock bottom .
but still NE_event-0 NE_political-party-0 do n't have enough support to get a majority under fptp .
now the NE_political-party-0 be face the unpopularity of ENT_government-organization-0 and NE_political-party-1 be ahead on the opinion poll .
the lib dem vote will collapse but i bet more of their vote go to NE_political-party-0 @/@ NE_political-party-1 than it do the NE_political-party-2 .
i think the NE_country-0 be a broadly NE_political-party-0 nation up till the -CONST--0 s but since then it have turn against them , they have their lowest ever day in the mid @-@ late -CONST--1 s and early -CONST--2 s , even since they 've have an upturn on the back of a NE_political-party-1 ENT_government-organization-0 run into problem , they 've not be able to build a broad base of support in the country like NE_person-0 or NE_person-1 do .
the tories do n't get a majority because NE_political-party-0 fix the boundries .
NE_political-party-0 get a majority in -CONST--0 with -CONST--1 vote but the tories come short in -CONST--2 despite have -CONST--3 more vote than this .
some analyst reckon the tories need just another -CONST--0 vote to get that majority .
i would have vote based on what i think be best for the country .
if i honestly think NE_political-party-0 could solve the problem , despite all my problem with them , i would have vote NE_political-party-1 .
but that be n't the case .
but a lot of NE_political-party-0 voter -CONST--0 know/ have meet , have tell me that they vote labour because ' NE_political-party-1 only care about the rich '.
and that be it , you ask them ENT_amr-unknown-0 they think that and....nothing .
or another common reason ' NE_political-party-0 will take away ema and give the moeny to the rich '.
well yes , they take away ema , but ema be a stupid system anyway , unfair and put in place by the NE_political-party-0 ENT_government-organization-0 to try and make unemployment figure look better .
most NE_political-party-0 voter i know in real life vote for them either out of ignorance and view inherit from their parents/peers .
or because they want their pocket directly line .
now , i know this be n't the case for all NE_political-party-0 voter , hell there be some intelligent one on NE_publication-0 , who vote for NE_political-party-1 for decent reason , and though -CONST--0 disagree -CONST--1 respect them for that .
i just feel that NE_political-party-0 get a lot of vote from the reverse @-@ snob work class in area like mine .
so they can quite literally do anything , and people will still vote for them over the NE_political-party-0 .
i 'm fairly right wing , but i do n't think a full on NE_political-party-0 ENT_government-organization-0 be what anyone want .
this be a centrist country and the ENT_government-organization-0 should reflect that .
i 'd like it if we elect very socially liberal ENT_government-organization-0 all the time ( to the point of legalising and tax all narcotic ) , but i know that won't happen .
i 'd like withdrawl from the NE_organization-0 , but that won't happen .
politics in most democratic country do usually hover around the centre .
apart from the NE_country-0 , but that 's a cultural thing really .
as a NE_political-party-0 supporter , i disagree with the cut that the NE_government-organization-0 be currently make .
they be go too far , too fast .
their policy of contractionary fiscal policy create a substantial risk of the NE_country-0 slip back into recession , which mean consumer confidence will begin to fall even further , as people will be more likely to save , which lead to less money be pump into the economy , ie . a fall in aggregate demand .
with current level of unemployment very high , job loss will be the consequence of these harsh , unnecessary cut through the NE_government-organization-0 's contractionary fiscal policy .
on the other hand , NE_government-organization-0 's policy of expansionary fiscal policy mean that although the budget deficit will increase , a significant number of job will be create , aggregate demand will increase , which mean an increase in consumer confidence , therefore household income will increase , which may result in taxpayers move into a higher tax band , which lead to an increase in ENT_government-organization-0 revenue from taxation .
if we carry on with the current rate of cut , we will reverse to the -CONST--0 's , make the poorest poor , and the rich rich , same old NE_government-organization-0 !
cut need to be make at a steady pace , with the budget deficit dealt with once the economy be full steam ahead .
all view , opinion and thought be more than welcome
definately pro @-@ cut , even though the wife lose her job , she still agree with the cut , it 's for the good of the country as a whole
pro cut for me to because if you invest in the public sector like NE_government-organization-0 would it mean your get growth based on debt which doesnt work then we 'll eventually have the same problem again and run out of other people money to spend .
the only way you can have growth be by private investment .
i 'm not against the cut per se .
i 'm just against the reform that be go to cost as much to implement as they save and be do for ideological rather than financial reason .
cut be more or less inevitable , even if i do n't necessarily agree with ENT_amr-unknown-0 , ENT_amr-unknown-1 , ENT_amr-unknown-2 , ENT_amr-unknown-3 and ENT_amr-unknown-4 .
it make me cringe that the ENT_government-organization-0 be cut fund for the NE_country-0 people , and yet somehow fund the military to rain cluster of bomb over foreign people !
to be honest as much as everyone dislike them i do n't see any other political party put forward a decent proposal
this country literally have no money and be in huge amount of debt
i 'm against the increase in uni fee though , on the whole -CONST--0 do realise that university fee do have to increase , but treble them within the space of -CONST--1 year be far too much
i apologise in advance if there be something similar to this thread , but this be a topic that have interest me recently and would just like to hear your view on the matter .
i 'm a NE_country-0 NE_country-1 , born and bring up in NE_city-0 , however i would say i be very much in touch with my root and my view lean more towards the traditional and conservative side .
recently -CONST--0 watch a documentary by NE_person-0 ' NE_documentary-0 ', make a few year ago , yet a very interesting watch .
i have be on holiday to NE_country-0 a fair amount of time , and have traveled throughout the country , so i think i have a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it 's people .
however , after watch the documentary and various other programs and film on NE_country-0 i be absolutely shock .
i may be wrong when i say this , but be NE_country-0 not found as a muslim state , yet only -CONST--0 year on and i do n't think the country match the vision it be initially create with .
it seem that the higher class be obsess with imitate and adopt NE_world-region-0 culture , in a sense it boost their superiority complex .
i actually find it shock , that most family who move to NE_country-0 in the 60 's like my grandfather have manage to maintain that cultural pride and certain tradition that have be lose among certain group of people in NE_country-1 .
drink be a common practice with the upper class society and personally i find it quite upset , it seem as if NE_country-0 be move in the opposite direction @- the rich become more obsess with NE_world-region-0 culture and the less well off be neglect further .
also whilst i 'm on this topic , have anyone see the NE_film-0 ' and ENT_amr-unknown-0 be your view ?
thank for read my thought !
liberalization be move in the opposite direction ?
personally , any nation 's judiciary system that be in anyway influence by objective morality scripture and superstition have no place in the -CONST--0 st century .
while i can understand your sentiment that be undesirable for tradition to be dismantle , ever since the fall of the wall in -CONST--0 , liberal democratic value have spread ( NE_book-0 , NE_person-0 , -CONST--1 ) and that do not preclude ( just yet ) the sovereign state whom be conform to NE_religious-group-0 teaching as their rule of law .
NE_world-region-0 culture give people individuality and let them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberty they desire ( as long as it do n't harm anybody else ) .
i think it be the right direction that NE_world-region-0 culture ( unforced ) be spread , it give a common ground for different culture to interact , promote tolerance and allow people to pick their own way of life .
i do n't see that be a problem .
and that 's a bad thing ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
westernisation = progress .
imitate the most developed country in the world be n't really a bad thing .
NE_country-0 be found on the basis that muslims feel their interest would not be guard by a NE_religious-group-0 ENT_government-organization-0 , not as some spiritual muslim homeland .
as it be , i 'd hardly say NE_country-0 be ' NE_world-region-0 ', what with it 's blasphemy law , it 's constant conflict with NE_country-1 , conservative populace , tacit fund and support for various islamist organisations .
i think rather than worry about the populace , worry about yourself .
who be you to judge people if they wish to drink alcohol , or watch NE_world-region-0 tv ?
also , as you bemoan the NE_world-region-0 . it 's worth remember you would n't have have a country without us
i simply do n't get ENT_amr-unknown-0 NE_country-0 be such a huge threat .
they be merely retaliate to whatever our politician throw at them !
" if NE_country-0 change course , abandon its nuclear weapon ambition , and life up to its international obligation , it will be welcome back into the community of nations."...
as a weak country with no big weapon to defend its people..
yeh right , they 're so on board with that !
all the huge country that be bully NE_country-0 into submission right now with sanction and ENT_amr-unknown-0 not have nuclear weapon ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 on earth be this fair ?
all the sanction be affect ordinary iranians !
soar food prices/ fuel...
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the world do nothing ? !
do we want NE_country-0 to become the next NE_country-1 ?
this be totally unacceptable !
not to mention the meddle we have be do inside NE_country-0 for the past -CONST--0 year or so... install the shah.. overthrow democratic governments...
hey NE_country-0 assassinate some more NE_country-1 scientist ?
absolutely degrade behaviour by the NE_world-region-0 , no wonder they hate us !
because they have a pretty crazy guy at the head of their goverment - who 's develop nuclear weapon .
not to mention the grudge they have against the NE_world-region-0 .
they have a bad history of blow thing @/@ people they dont like up...
NE_person-0 , quaint... be you all dispute irans know history of terrorism or be you all moron ?
because NE_person-0 be a maniac .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 kind of history do the NE_country-0 have then ?
dont remember NE_country-0 start a war the last..lets say -CONST--0 year ?
that be a tongue in cheek remark i wasnt be entirely serious .
largely rhetoric to lie the groundwork to get support for the war .
this be n't do properly before go to war in NE_country-0 and we have people oppose to it from the start , also go in with mix message ' its about wmd and a bit about regime change ' look bad when there be n't any wmd there .
so we need to go in from the start say with NE_country-0 it 's about regime change , NE_person-0 be bad , he do n't respect womens right or whatever otherwise you will have the same situation if we say its about nuclear weapon and then go to war and do n't find any nuclear weapon .
i can understand the argument that nuclear proliferation be bad and any of these state have nuclear weapon be not desirable as it just lead to proliferation in the region , but that argument should have be use against NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 get nukes .
people say NE_country-0 have nukes be a risk because terrorist might be able to get hold of nuclear material...
well hello...pakistan have them .
remember when we go in to take out NE_person-0 we could n't tell the NE_country-0 ENT_government-organization-0 for fear that -CONST--0 would have be tip off and escaped...
that hardly fill me with confidence that they should be allow to have nuclear weapon .
the problem with these ' resolution ' targeting NE_country-0 be that everyone can see the hypocrisy , its a case of our ally can have nukes but others can n't .
a much better resolution would have be a hard resolution on non proliferation and disarmament in the region , which mean NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 have to disarm and NE_country-2 have to disarm , and any move by any country in the region towards get nuclear weapon would be meet by international air strike .
i could definitely support that as a non proliferation treaty .
i 've heard story of NE_country-0 , indians , bengalis , filipinos , NE_country-1 and NE_ethnic-group-0 with NE_continent-0 root be racially abuse in place like NE_country-2 , NE_country-3 , NE_country-4 and so on...
are you a non @-@ NE_ethnic-group-0 minority live in the middle @-@ east , or do you know someone who do ?
do you feel that the problem of racism be a big or a small one in comparison to place like NE_continent-0 ( the southern state in particular )?
it 's not so much racist , as -CONST--0 be ' classist '.
people from NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , and so on often work as maid , driver , etc. in the NE_world-region-0 .
they do n't abuse you because you 're a certain skin color , they abuse you because they think you 're some servant that barely make any money and should be grateful for be there .
yes , there be racism in some NE_ethnic-group-0 country in the NE_world-region-0 .
if you be from NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 or any country that be n't very rich then you be mostly treat like crap .
however , if you be NE_country-0 , or from the NE_country-1 or any other rich NE_continent-0 country then they treat you really well .
NE_country-0 in particular be treat badly , there be indian maid and -CONST--0 be often hit by the house wife if they for example make a small mistake or sometimes they be hit with no reason .
i have relative who live in one of those rich NE_world-region-0 country and as far as i know they tell me that some of them whilst at school have experience racisms from children for example one of them a girl be call black and ugly and that her hair be bad but the teacher do n't do anything about it , they be racist themselves .
i have to admit i be really quite worry about russia..
in the mainstream media and popular consciousness the big doomsday scenario mainly centre around NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 , obviously both of those be grossly misrepresent , the idea of a NE_country-2 @-@ NE_country-3 war for example be objectively absurd and no serious commentator pay it any attention , it 's really just a propaganda tool and an exciting subject for video game .
the situation in NE_country-0 have the ability to cause a lot of misery in the NE_world-region-0 but again , iranian leader be really quite self aware , they know what they be do , and there be near enough no risk to the world at large even if they do acquire nuclear weapon of them actually use them , although we as simple peasant obviously need to believe that and go along with our ENT_government-organization-0 because if NE_country-1 do become a nuclear power then it will have a lot more independence and influence in the region and that obviously can n't be tolerate .
anyway , NE_country-0 , it seem to me , be the real potential doomsday scenario here .
almost all the condition of wiemar NE_country-0 be present ; economic downturn , unemployment , a recent history of loss of empire , rise nationalism and xenophobia .
and just like NE_country-0 there be a hard turn to the far right by the country 's middle class and the rise of egomaniacal leader who be already undermine what little democracy there have be in NE_country-1 .
there be even NE_person-0 youth league harass opponent above the law .
you have the ultra nationalist and deeply racist NE_tribe-0 , highly militant , extremely aggressive and become more and more mobilised , convince that the time have come for mother NE_country-0 and that x , y and z ethnic/religion/political group be responsible for the loss of NE_country-1 's glory and therefore must be eliminate .
just like NE_country-0 be , NE_country-1 still be a major military power , a nuclear one , and with -CONST--0 .
honestly when you think about it it really do look just.. terrify .
am i miss something here ?
can anyone explain further or recommend some read ?
yes , NE_country-0 do have huge problem with neo @-@ nazi ideology ( which be kind of ironic give the history of NE_country-1 ) .
it 's military be pretty brutal as well - see NE_province-0 .
NE_country-0 regularly interfere in it 's neighbour ( such as the NE_country-1 and the invasion of NE_country-2 when it become too NE_world-region-0 ) , but i do n't think it have much power beyond that , that be n't to say that they would n't if they could .
but they be hem in by NE_country-0 , NE_continent-0 and the NE_country-1 .
there be a lot of bitterness about how ex @-@ NE_country-0 state have become part of ' the NE_world-region-0 ' ( like poland and estonia for example ) .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 specifically be you concern about ?
it be n't go to invade NE_continent-0 again if that 's what you be concern about .
i mean they help the invasion of NE_country-0 and NE_person-0 ask to join NE_military-0 .
their close " NE_world-region-0 " ally be NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 ( and they be close ) .
NE_country-0 be n't really that close to any major power .
i disagree with this , at least not without huge structural change .
it have terrible future demographics ( with no available fix through immigration ) and be totally dependent on export oil and gas - as well as be run by corrupt oligarch ( who make NE_world-region-0 corporatism look non @-@ corrupt and benevolent ) .
i think NE_country-0 be pretty neutral about most international affair now , so i do n't see the big worry .
NE_country-0 have be reduce to nothing but a peripheral country that condemn whatever resolution the NE_world-region-0 put forward .
the NE_country-0 ENT_government-organization-0 be pretty bad , but ENT_government-organization-1 opposition be worse .
the leader of the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 largest party in NE_country-0 , the NE_political-party-0 , want NE_country-1 to be " re @-@ stalinised ".
the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 largest NE_political-party-0 , be pretty nutty too .
-CONST--0 off , a disclaimer of sort , these be my opinion based on news report and a little research around the topic so i apologise if my fact be wrong or inaccurate .
like the title say i welcome thought either on my opinion , or on the matter in question .
anyone who follow the news will have hear in amidst all the " NE_organization-0 crisis " there be an issue grow between the NE_world-region-0 and the NE_world-region-1 .
specifically NE_country-0 and its attempt at a nuclear program , where NE_country-1 hope to gain nuclear power for peaceful purpose ( NE_country-2 's statement ) .
the NE_country-0 and NE_organization-0 however believe that NE_country-1 be use this nuclear program to develop and obtain nuclear weapon claim they have " information suggest NE_country-2 have carry out test relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device ".
due to this the NE_country-0 and NE_organization-0 have impose sanction on NE_country-1 involve limit on the oil buy from NE_country-2 which in turn decrease their economy and other sanction of similar consequence .
right now that that 's do i can state my opinion , -CONST--0 correct anything i have put that be wrong !
my opinion in short be this , the NE_country-0 and NE_organization-0 have no right to impose sanction on NE_country-1 and to deter their nuclear program .
however , i be very oppose to NE_country-0 gain nuclear weapon and threaten ww3 and in fact i be oppose to any country have nuclear weapon .
the only argument the NE_country-0 and NE_organization-0 have be that NE_country-1 be not a stable country at the moment and a unstable country should n't be able to kill -CONST--0 at the touch of a button .
however for them to tell another country what they can n't have , when they have nuclear weapon themselves be nothing except hypocrisy .
from NE_country-0 's point of view , one could argue that our ENT_government-organization-0 be unstable with new leader every -CONST--0 year with differ opinion and view .
what right do we have to dictate what another country can and cannot do .
i think that 's the essence of my argument , and i accept that the " NE_country-0 instability " be a big part of the sanction .
thank you for read and i hope i 'm not completely ignorant here !
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do country not have a right to tell others what to do ?
people tell each other what to do all day every day , ENT_amr-unknown-0 should country be exempt ?
of course , NE_country-0 have every right to say " no ", but then those other country have every right to refuse to trade with them .
though i do n't believe we should have nuclear weapon either - it 's not hypocritical as such .
have a new leader every -CONST--0 year do n't make a country unstable ( otherwise irans single leader would be highly stable ) .
most country who have nuclear weapon now can be trust not to abuse -CONST--0 - NE_country-0 cannot .
regardless , i personally do n't think world security should be hold back just because someone be worry about be a bit hypocritical .
i believe that the only reason why NE_country-0 gun sight have be train on NE_country-1 be because of NE_country-2 decision to switch from petro @-@ dollar ( NE_country-3 ) to the gold standard or something similar .
this would would have a detrimental effect on the NE_country-0 economy , or practically any economy that relies on the dollar as a currency and as a result , the already weak NE_country-1 economy would lose it 's lead place .
all the other aspect , nuclear power and oppressive regime be just a side issue .
this be demonstrate time and time again when NE_person-0 switch to euros in -CONST--0 and NE_person-1 want to switch to the gold standard before he be topple .
the NE_organization-0 also want something similar and i do n't know what happen to that .
there be still no evidence against NE_country-0 .
the NE_organization-0 have be in many time .
all we have be suspicion .
also the NE_organization-0 publish the name of all NE_country-0 nuclear scientist be rather sinister .
they very well knew this be like gold dust to NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 ie assassination target . impartiality ?
i think not .
the hypocrisy argument get nowhere , but most fail to understand the double standard suggest an ulterior motive , at the least a lack in credibility of the NE_world-region-0 .
NE_country-0 have illegally obtain and continue to have a nuclear arsenal , not to mention the innumerable NE_organization-0 violation against it 's neighbour , yet it be metaphorically scot free to do as it please .
it 's like they be play NE_game-0 : the political leadership of NE_country-0 / NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 seem to me more likely to " go all in " rather than back down and fold or negotiate .
i think it 's a while off yet .
NE_country-0 be have a decent time trade with the NE_world-region-0 , and try to stick -CONST--0 finger up to the NE_world-region-1 .
neither side want 's to jepordise their economic security by engage in what will be a costly and deadly military action .
i think the only problem will come if and when iran stop allow nuclear inspection , or when the un/nato/the NE_world-region-0 decide that there be a high probability that NE_country-0 be near realisation of weaponised nulcear material .
i personally find NE_country-0 's behaviour at the NE_organization-0 this week to be absolutely disgust .
apparently they 're threaten to veto a resolution on NE_country-0 if it do not explicitly rule out foreign military intervention .
the text have already be ' water down ' to omit the demand that NE_person-0 step down , yet again to appease the NE_government-organization-0 .
every day nearly -CONST--0 innocent civilian be be massacre by the fascist ENT_government-organization-0 in NE_country-0 ( at a far quick rate than those NE_country-1 who have die at the hand of NE_country-2 ) .
but ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the demonstration ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the ' blood for oil ' and ' victory to the intifada ' moron ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the hysterical student compare NE_person-0 to NE_person-1 and NE_person-2 to an NE_military-0 commandant ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the NE_country-0 flag be display next to swastika ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be NE_person-0 's film condemn these indiscriminate murder ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 's the public outcry about NE_country-0 veto and unilateralism ( a criticism routinely employ - rightly - against the NE_country-1 when NE_country-2 veto resolution on NE_country-3 aggression )?
so many have be kill that the NE_organization-0 have give up try to count casualty , and yet we have a clique of barbarian and mafia crook in NE_city-0 hold the world hostage over this issue .
NE_country-0 be renovate a military base in NE_country-1 , have arm deal worth -CONST--0 , infrastructure and energy deal .
NE_country-0 oil , gas and steel company have substantial interest in NE_country-1 include an NE_country-2 gas pipeline , gas process plant , deal with national syrian oil company and oil exploration there .
NE_country-0 want stability and a friendly regime to ensure the security of their interest , so they back NE_person-0 .
that 's NE_country-0 for you .
nevertheless , NE_person-0 would be lucky if he survive this year .
it 's a similar situation to NE_country-0 .
the rebel need help with the big military target , but when it come to grind operation , they be more than capable of handle the situation .
if you wish to understand NE_country-0 's reason , know -CONST--0 national interest .
in this case arm contract worth $ -CONST--0 be a national interest .
no way be they go to let that go down the drain if they can do something about it .
nor be they will to lose face by openly support the NE_country-0 regime .
they will just exercise their NE_organization-0 privilege and keep sneak the promised weapon into NE_country-0 -CONST--0 way or the other and keep cash in on the opportunity .
personally , i do n't think they would start ww3 if NE_country-0 be attack , because they have more to lose , and they 'd probably just do thing like supply weapon etc...
any one else have an opinion on this ?
if ww3 do break out , we know we can go to NE_country-0 or NE_country-1
good to see NE_country-0 back the NE_country-1 .
whilst i think the prospect of ww3 be a slight bit of over kill the chinese do have a point in that the NE_world-region-0 be in no position to meddle in iranian affair least of all at this stage
NE_country-0 hey dude , sup
NE_country-0 hows it goin bro
NE_country-0 yeh just u no how u like killin your own peep just like i do ?
NE_country-0 yeh lol
NE_country-0 let like hang out together n attack ppl who try to stop us killin our peep
NE_country-0 sure thing bro
NE_country-0 would eventually lose .
anyone , watch any of the gop NE_political-party-0 presidential debate , as you can see the media pathetic effort for pretend that NE_person-0 do n't exist .
NE_person-0 be right on every level but the mainstream media do not want him to get as much talk time as other puppet such as NE_person-1 santo rum and NE_person-2
i 'm in .
he be amaze , the only person who can take the NE_country-0 forward .
however , he appear to be lose steam as a result of the time of NE_state-0 and NE_state-1 .
do you realise that NE_person-0 would disapprove of the video in your sig vehemently ?
probably , but then due to the fact it 's get more space , the NE_country-0 do n't have the same problem with NE_religious-group-0 as NE_continent-0 do .
also , the NE_country-0 's biggest problem at the moment be an economic one .
people be say this everywhere now and the consequence be unknow .
could this really happen ?
only if NE_person-0 doesnt become president then there will be war .
the NE_country-0 have n't the capacity to commit to a full @-@ scale war with NE_country-1 at present if one keep in mind its quite significant pre @-@ exist commitment , the state of the economy , and the strength of NE_country-2 's defensive capability - targeted strike( s ) seem more likely , or perhaps greater action by NE_country-3 , but i doubt that .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the NE_country-0 allow NE_person-0 and her -CONST--0 children to remain in the uk ?
i know she be born and raise in NE_city-0 , but do you think that the NE_country-0 be as anti @-@ NE_person-0 as it claim ?
-CONST--0 word , -CONST--1 letter , -CONST--2 vowel , -CONST--3 consonant .
oil
but there be sanction on oil export ?
i know this sound too nice but it 's maybe because a person family should not suffer for the ' crime ' of an individual .
she 's NE_country-0 i think .
we 've be hear a lot in the news about NE_country-0 and its threat to shut the straight NE_strait-0 , and how NE_world-region-0 country ( e.g . the NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 ) , but ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the country around the straight react to the threat ?
as i cant seem to find anything on how country such as NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 the NE_country-2 be react .
wild speculation be welcome here
this be backwards .
it 's not a threat , it 's a response to the threat of others , e.g " attack us and we 'll close the NE_strait-0 ".
there be nothing for other country to respond to .
they be the would @-@ be aggressor .
unfortunately most tsr'rs be too brainwash to see that .
just so stupid .
NE_country-0 's the only one with the ball to stand up to israel/usa .
if they fall due to the surround country go against them , then they 'll continue remain sheeps and it won't be long till they 're topple themselves .
i support NE_country-0 's arm up though , as i do for all muslim nation , weapon may be useful in future .
the NE_country-0 only exist in part because of NE_country-1 .
NE_country-0 sell almost -CONST--0 $ of arm to the NE_religious-group-0 republic during the NE_country-1 @-@ NE_country-2 war and provide load of military aid ( this be while NE_country-3 be apparently a suppose sworn enemy ) , train and even helpfully remove NE_country-4 's nuclear capacity in NE_event-0 ; where if NE_person-0 have develop nuclear weaponry he would have undoubtedly use against NE_country-5 .
did you know that there be a camp just outside NE_city-0 of NE_country-0 tactician aid NE_person-0 and co against NE_country-1 for the whole of the conflict with NE_country-2 ?
the NE_country-0 owe an awful lot to NE_country-1 - it enable it to survive against NE_person-0 and continue the war with NE_country-2 ( by continue the war this enabled it to solidify it 's position by kill -CONST--0 and -CONST--1 of NE_country-3 democrat and other member of the opposition - as well as terrorising the population ) .
do n't forget that NE_country-0 support NE_country-1 when they invade NE_country-2 and NE_country-3 as well .
these be the fact :
in the west , it be threaten by NE_country-0 , in which NE_country-1 force be still present
in the east , NE_country-0 have at least -CONST--0 NE_country-1 troop alone
south @-@ east , NE_country-0 nuclear arm , corrupt official and be a NE_country-1 ally
all around be NE_ethnic-group-0 country with friendly tie to the NE_country-0 who keep rally for the ' head to be cut off the snake '
north @-@ west , NE_country-0 , NE_military-0 ally
north @-@ east contain refuel station for NE_country-0 millitary vehicle in NE_country-1
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be really be threaten here ?
sorry to inform you : that be exactly why we would go to war -CONST--0
as nice as it would be for country like the NE_country-0 and the NE_country-1 to be over there to help , the truth be we would n't interfere if it be n't for the oil and other economic and political gain .
if they do restrict the straight it will will cause a massive decrease in the amount of oil to the west ( -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of import oil come from the straight accord to a figure i see on the news ) , and our economy would greatly suffer...
we would in that situation definitely cause a big commotion .
i highly doubt there would be a ww3 , but i do know for certain that the big country and supper power would go to NE_war-0 due to globalisation and economic link .
in NE_country-0 the poor quality of local broadcaster 's international news seem to have completely baffle the general population as to exactly what be go on , the coverage be utterly appeal to be honest and regularly confuse their nuclear programs and their attempt to blockade the NE_strait-0 homuz .
politically the general gist of thing be that the current NE_political-party-0 ENT_government-organization-0 be stuck between suck up to the NE_country-0 and therefore get embroil in any potential conflict ( NE_ship-0 be presently off NE_country-1 under NE_military-0 command and could get draft in should military action commence ) and the fact that the NE_political-party-1 now have control over them through their control of the NE_government-organization-0 and their single NE_government-organization-1 seat ( hung parliament for you ) and of course be very anti @-@ war , anti @-@ nato and anti @-@ anzus .
the ultimate result will be down to who be prime minister when such a situation occur , accord to the union they intend to fire NE_person-0 next month and replace her with NE_person-1 yet again who be extremely pro @-@ NE_country-0 and less align with the NE_country-1 although he will probably suck up to NE_person-2 as well .
the opposition will attempt to counter any potential for enter the war with statement such as " they 'll be NE_country-0 boatpeople " cause national panic and further hatred of innocent refugee potentially lead to an early election and a coalition ( NE_political-party-0 @-@ NE_political-party-1 ) ENT_government-organization-0 be form who will support the war to a degree but otherwise will be to focused on NE_country-1 which be the main aim of their entire foreign policy .
over these past -CONST--0 year , i have notice an increase amount of NE_country-0 news report which have culminated in the recent attack on the NE_country-1 NE_government-organization-0 with both country expel our respective diplomat .
it now seem certain to me that within the next decade the NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 among others will be involve in a fully fledge war against NE_country-2 .
throughout history , the expel of diplomat have usually meant one thing and when this be couple with the NE_event-0 alongside general unrest for a long period in NE_country-0 , it seem inevitable we be head towards another war .
as a general question , i would like to ask others to see what you think ?
are we go to war , what can we do to avoid this and just in general for people to air their opinion on another war in the NE_world-region-0 .
p.s. just to clarify i be neither anti nor pro war , this be just a launch pad for a discussion .
given the NE_country-0 mentality i would say we will see NE_country-1 strike NE_country-2 .
would't be shock if they use nukes either tbh
that be a big claim ,
it would quite an amaze escalation if NE_country-0 use nuclear bomb on NE_country-1 .
i know , however NE_country-0 be go to know that if they strike NE_country-1 will hit back .
conventional weapon may not even be able to hit some of the fortified facility either .
the idea of a single debilitate strike on NE_country-0 that will stop it ever be able to strike back be go to be very very tempt for NE_country-1 .
and depending on which way the NE_country-0 election go -CONST--0 support may not be forthcoming if someone like NE_person-0 get elect
if they have @/@ get nukes , no one 's invade NE_country-0 .
i personally think it would be cool , NE_country-0 might have to think -CONST--0 before carry out major bombings in palastine etc.
there will always be that deterrant if NE_country-0 get nukes .
of course not but the question be fast become not will NE_country-0 strike but ENT_amr-unknown-0 and how .
a conventional strike on NE_country-0 be go to raise massive geopolitical consequence too . include huge damage to the world economy and the possible destruction of NE_country-1 .
bit of a novice at economics but i be wonder , after NE_person-0 's death why be the stock market in NE_continent-0 @/@ NE_country-0 fall ;
be they anticipate something ? thank
this will hopefully herald the end of socialism as we know it as people will realise that it be doom to fail .
just lead to insecurity in market
you look at koreas neighbour NE_country-0 , south NE_country-1 etc all major player in the world economy .
im sure some dirty banker have vest interest also .
but ENT_amr-unknown-0 to say it be NE_person-0 bring down the market .
with the primary quickly approach i think it would be a good idea to have a thread on everything relate to the -CONST--0 election .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do people think will be the NE_political-party-0 nominee ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think have the best chance of beat NE_person-0 ?
for me it seem that it be go to come down to a two @-@ way race for the nomination between NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 .
i can n't see any of the others get the nomination .
NE_person-0 probably have a better chance than NE_person-1 of beat NE_person-2 .
there be now a poll .
if you do n't think any of the candidate can beat NE_person-0 then that go under ' other '.
i personally would like to see NE_person-0 be the nominee , but NE_person-1 probably have better chance of become a NE_company-0 than this happen .
the republican will probably go with NE_person-0 over NE_person-1 .
it be a shame that scandal have hit NE_person-0 because -CONST--0 have promise .
i be an NE_political-party-0 voter and my opinion be that who ever the NE_political-party-1 nominee be , they probably won't be willing to do what 's necessary for the u.s. economy if elect .
if NE_person-0 be reelected he definitely won't be willing to do what 's necessary for the economy .
i hope most other independent feel the same .
i 'd be happy with anyone but NE_person-0 nothing less than our economy 's complete demise and be clearly anti @-@ NE_country-0 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do everybody think about the possibility of go to war with NE_country-0 ?
the NE_country-0 be make move encourage a very likely chance of war !
do you think it will happen ?
do you think it should happen ? discuss...
mark my word . no other country will attack NE_country-0 except for NE_country-1 , with perhaps military support in term of intelligence from the us/uk .
the NE_country-0 do not have the mean to carry out an attack on NE_country-1 . -
forget the fact that the us/uk/nato would never get the support from the international community to carry out an attack .
NE_country-0 ? they can do what they want .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be people view on the current NE_country-0 occupation of NE_country-1 .
should it be free from their imperialist grip etc....?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you 's think of the current arm struggle ?
was the war involve the ira and inla a success or a failure ?
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 be your view on those try to establish a socialist republic in NE_country-0 ( not the NE_military-0 's )?
i really do n't think anyone in NE_country-0 care much about NE_country-1 .
i do n't think many people really understand why you insist on murder each other either .
NE_country-0 need to overcome its grip of alcohol .
first , NE_country-0 no long occupy the southen -CONST--0 state .
the idea of an arm struggle be preposterous , even to strong nationalist the idea of free healthcare , a stronger economy and less corrupt politics make war even more ridiculous .
currently those in the ira be terrorist fight a pointless war they 'll never win .
socialism be in itself a fair theory for ENT_government-organization-0 , yet no country have establish a socialist republic that be superior to the current democracy
the law of return give NE_religious-group-0 people and those who half NE_religious-group-1 on their mother 's side the right to become NE_country-0 citizen .
this be a ridiculous sexist and racist law that nation around the world should oppose .
NE_country-0 be now refuse to give aid to country who discriminate against gay , we must now do the same to sexist and racist nation .
a number of state world wide have similar discrimination , however we deem NE_country-0 as a modernised civilize society .
NE_country-0 must set an example to these less develop nation by scrape this outrageous policy .
what if the ENT_government-organization-0 say all people of NE_continent-0 heritage be free to become NE_country-0 citizen would we call ENT_government-organization-1 racist ?
NE_country-0 be a NE_religious-group-0 state , specifically .
create for the NE_religious-group-0 people , do n't seem that odd that if you 're NE_religious-group-1 you 're allow citizenship .
judaism be pass through the mother ( a jewish mother make you a full blood NE_religious-group-0 , not half jewish ) that 's how judaims work .
so it 's not that sexist per se it simply follow the NE_religious-group-0 law of inheritance .
other religion be pass soley through the father , be they sexist too ?
make NE_thing-0 be n't exactly a small step...
and as soon as you 're a citizen if you 're under -CONST--0 ( -CONST--1 for women ) you will have to join the NE_military-0 .
i just do n't think it 's that shock or appal .
also , they have a very good refugee policy - they 'll take pretty much anyone who be flee for safety .
country be free to make up immigration rule as they please .
it happen here in the NE_country-0 and around the world .
for example if my grandfather be a NE_country-0 citizen born in the NE_country-1 , who then move and marry a none NE_country-2 citizen , and they then have my mother outside of the NE_country-3 , my mother would still be eligible for citizenship .
however if my mother then marry a non brit and give birth to me outside of NE_country-0 i would no longer be eligible for citizenship as citizenship right only extend -CONST--0 generation in the uk .
however if it be NE_country-0 instead of the NE_country-1 i would still be eligible for citizenship if my grandfather be irish .
so i would be NE_country-0 if my grandfather be NE_country-1 , but i would not be NE_country-2 if my grandfather be NE_country-3 .
be this discriminatory ? yes..
but immigration law by their very nature be discriminatory , that be their whole purpose , to discriminate who be and who be n't allow into a country .
all nation have them and they all tend to be different ( which be normal consider different nation have different culture , tradition and custom ) , it just so happen that in NE_country-0 the requirement be that your mother be @/@ be NE_religious-group-0 , it be different to requirments in other country but it be no less valid .
read the newspaper today you may have see an article regard a teenager call -CONST--0 -CONST--1 .
he be part of a scheme organised to document the effect of drone strike , he be give a camera .
on his way to his aunt house he and his -CONST--0 year old cousin be slaughter by an illegal NE_government-organization-0 drone strike .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 the **** be wrong with NE_country-0 ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 will go to ****ing court because of this ?
no @-@ one cos its NE_country-0 , and they be clearly above the law because they have money .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 the **** can NE_country-0 complain about NE_country-1 home @-@ make rocket when they 're use drone without a care in teh world ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do NE_country-0 have the right to ****ing attack anywhere its want without any accountability ?
it 's not a bloody NE_product-0 killstreak .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 they kill civillians do they have the cheek , to quote NE_newspaper-0 article to say ' they 're have be no collateral damage in drone attack ' ENT_amr-unknown-1 accord to NE_newspaper-1 time again there be picture of incinerate young children ?
now do you understand why many people , especially muslims have a gripe against the NE_country-0 ?
at least most muslims be sane , unlike the NE_country-0 goverment who just can n't seem to ENT_government-organization-0 commit terrorist act .
i 'm sorry for the swear , i 'm not one to usually swear , but the NE_government-organization-0 et al be a joke .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 the negs ?
the kill of this and several other innocent be okay ?
if NE_country-0 sent a little drone to NE_country-1 and do the samething , ENT_amr-unknown-0 would the ramifcations be ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would the outcry be like..?
NE_person-0 i suggest that you watch the NE_documentary-0 ''secret pakistan'' on NE_product-0 and then come back to argue .
this suppose ally of the NE_country-0 be train and prepare innocent NE_country-1 children who be too young to understand NE_religious-group-0 properly to go into a busy NE_country-2 bazaar to blow up innocent -CONST--0 civilian .
this be what NE_country-0 deserve for fund lunatic NE_religious-group-0 rebel since the the -CONST--0 s against any NE_country-1 ENT_government-organization-0 that have exist .
it be the price pay for the -CONST--0 dead NE_country-0 during the NE_country-1 occupation and the civil war which -CONST--1 fund .
the truth be , every time these drone hit , they kill maybe -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 terrorist ( at max ) and -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 civilian .
each of this civilian be a real human with real emotion , not just a statistic .
for instance , a -CONST--0 year old kid see their father blown to piece , you expect them to love the NE_country-0 ?
they become radicalised and ready to murder NE_country-0 at any cost .
NE_country-0 strategically target civilian so they have a reason to stay there due to further radicalisation of youth .
i try to watch the NE_program-0 " but the question i keep ask be ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
in the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 -CONST--0 - -CONST--1 minute they never explain why NE_country-0 would want to double cross .
now do n't get me wrong there will be people within the intellilgence who be double cross and have a secret agenda .
but to the highest level as a whole ENT_amr-unknown-0 would the ENT_government-organization-0 want such destabilisation from all angle .
the president be corrupt and money hungry but i would say that there be plenty of easier way for him to do that if he so please and put the country into turmoil and him in a terrible light would surely be foolish .
and re the whole drone thingn i really struggle to understand how they can be justify at all .
when lot of people in NE_country-0 die in -CONST--0 they feel angry , agrieved and wwant revenge .
to do this they go on a long war result in -CONST--0 of death and also do not take regard for country ' sovereignty .
now again a lot if not the majority of death be not cause by the NE_country-0 directly but a significantly large number be therefore it be still a valid point to raise .
i would love to know how a NE_country-0 citizen would react if bomb be drop on their home town by a foreign country .
i 'm sure they would be happy to forget it and want no justice .
you know what i love ?
all these people say ohh , you be create the terrorism !
well , we would n't be do anytyhing be it not for the terrorist in the first place .
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 cause have they ?
they do n't like NE_country-0 foireign policy .
so instead of go to a parliment meet , they go to armory and decide to blow **** up and kill innocent .
you want someone to blame for the death of civilian in NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 , look no further than muslim terrorist .
i think most people be look at this , again , without an objective analysis of the situation .
ever since the intervention in NE_country-0 and drone attack of NE_country-1 , can anyone give me a successful attack by NE_criminal-organization-0 on the NE_world-region-0 since the -CONST--0 ?
some people should know better that the NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 ally be not on some mission to kill innocent civilian , quite the contrary .
most of the contribution in this topic have fail to recognize that NE_religious-group-0 fundamentalist have be operate in NE_country-0 and be the root cause of terrorism in that area .
in -CONST--0 , NE_country-0 see -CONST--1 terrorist attack leave -CONST--2 people dead .
in -CONST--0 , NE_country-0 see -CONST--1 terrorist attack , result in -CONST--2 casualty .
in -CONST--0 , NE_country-0 see -CONST--1 terrorist attack , result in -CONST--2 casualty .
in -CONST--0 , NE_country-0 see -CONST--1 terrorist attack , that result in -CONST--2 fatality .
terrorist attack have kill over -CONST--0 people .
if we compare this to figure of civilian casualty ( which i will go into ) it be quite a healthy ratio as of the -CONST--0 to -CONST--1 kill , -CONST--2 be think to be civilian , in contrast of the NE_criminal-organization-0 @/@ NE_criminal-organization-1 's operation to kill civilian .
interestingly , the number of terror attack in NE_country-0 drop which can prove to be conclusive evidence of the effect on NE_criminal-organization-0 and NE_criminal-organization-1 leadership and their effective operational capability that be decrease .
one can logically say these drone attack be work , which be report on both side if you look at the current fragmentation of NE_criminal-organization-0 and asscoatied jihadist sect leadership operate on the NE_country-0 @-@ NE_country-1 border .
from a strategy perspective , in -CONST--0 and -CONST--1 , air drone be equip with new missile call -CONST--2 -CONST--3 -CONST--4 ( ssw ) or typically know as ' -CONST--5 .'
these missile have increase accuracy and expand surveillance , include the use of small , unarm surveillance drone to pinpoint the exact location of target .
ever since the introduction of civilian causality countermeasure technology , NE_company-0 report that -CONST--0 militant be kill and only -CONST--1 civilian kill in drone attack in mid @-@ -CONST--2 .
NE_organization-0 believe that civilian casaulties have decrease from -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 to an estimate -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 , with a total of -CONST--2 civilian kill since -CONST--3 -CONST--4 .
on the ground of legality , accord to the NE_treaty-0 , member of regular arm force - involve in conflict - be the only person who may be consider lawful combatant and authorised to use lethal force .
the operator in NE_country-0 be the NE_military-0 ( usaf ) and the pakistani military .
so , ENT_amr-unknown-0 really murder more ?
NE_religious-group-0 fundamentalist group total of -CONST--0 casualty ( since -CONST--1 ) or the NE_country-0 ' -CONST--2 casualty ( since -CONST--3 )?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can n't people think the same thing ? if it be -CONST--0 american kid dad there would be media furore .
i do n't see these -CONST--0 kid name on the news ?
yet we see soldier who make a choice to go and fight on the news when they die .
actually , it do
that be the very definition of democracy , if something pass by the tiniest fraction of a percent need then everyone and everything else can be ignore .
of course this be not how we work , but then you can n't start say we 're undemocratic because people do n't turn out for the vote , that be their problem , not the ENT_government-organization-0 .
and -CONST--0 don ; t get start on the coalition .
it be democratic because together they recieved more vote than NE_political-party-0 , so they have a right to power .
right , so to you there 's no difference in blow up -CONST--0 's of civilian in a crowd market place , and blow up a build but phone the threat in beforehand to minimise civilian casualty ? in that case , it 's ok every , bishy just basically say collaterol damage do n't exist for any NE_world-region-0 force as there 's no distinction between force use . let 's start bomb civilian area , it just do n't matter apparantly and of course , i do n't condone either group , afterall , the NE_military-0 's aim be only achieve after they lay down their arm .
no more than it be for someone to blow you up .
there seem to be a misconception hold by some that NE_country-0 be not a welfare state .
do anyone know the percentage of gdp they spend on welfare and benefit of all kind compare to say NE_country-0 or the scandanavian nation ?
- who be usually consider the biggest welfare state in the world .
edit :
ok , so i have have look today and it look like NE_country-0 spend -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of its budget on welfare programme .
-CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 if you add pension .
look at this chart here from the us ENT_government-organization-0 spend website .
it have -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 health , -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 pension , and -CONST--2 ENT_percentage-entity-2 welfare .
be that ENT_amr-unknown-0 to work it out ?
-CONST--0 : //www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_spending
yes , a lot of money ( read . too much money ) be spend on ss etc.
however , the taxation rate on average be still -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 higher at least in european nation .
this be why we need a NE_political-party-0 ENT_government-organization-0 to try and decrease our ridiculous ENT_government-organization-1 spend .
NE_political-party-0 do nothing but spend money , and fight war --- and encourage war --- and spend more money try to put americans in a constant state of fear .
NE_political-party-0 be a joke
apparently -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of americas budget be spend on NE_program-0 @/@ NE_program-1 and NE_program-2 which be a joke consider how naff NE_country-0 welfare be
suppose you get a letter that state you must attend -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 of military train before you be send to iran/zimbabwe/syria to protect the civilian from oppression .
it must be on ground to minimise civilian casualty .
your friend be go to protect these civilian too .
do you go or do you sacrifice your dignity ?
this be a " humanitarian " mission after all .
not go would in no way sacrifice your dignity .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 if you have -CONST--0 children to fee ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would make the choice not to leave them alone and destitute mean you surrender your dignity .
this be nonsense .
in answer to the more general question you be try to pose : no , i would n't .
anybody who do such work deserve all of our respect ( assume no ulterior motive ) but it be n't for everyone , and that do n't make somebody a bad person .
i would protect my family and friend , i have no interest in personally protect strangers...
i 'm not here to save the world , in no way do that decision impact my dignity
in -CONST--0 NE_country-0 be the poorest country in the world , before the NE_military-0 intervention NE_country-1 enjoy the highest standard of live in NE_continent-0 .
in NE_country-0 , home be consider a human right .
newly marry couple receive $ -CONST--0 to buy their own home and electricity be free for all .
im not make all this up
NE_person-0 vow to house every NE_country-0 before his own parent , he keep his promise and his own father die before he be able to be house .
before NE_person-0 , less than -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 th of NE_country-0 be literate .
now education be free and high quality .
literacy rate be now -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 .
healthcare be also free .
if libyans cannot find the education or healthcare they need in NE_country-0 the ENT_government-organization-0 unds them to go abroad to access it .
all loan be interest free by law .
if a NE_country-0 buy a car , the ENT_government-organization-0 pay -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the price .
the price of fuel be $.14 -CONST--0 gallon .
any NE_country-0 wish to become a farmer be give free use of land , a home , equipment , livestock and seed .
on -CONST--0 -CONST--1 sr -CONST--2 , 1.7million people assemble in NE_facility-0 , NE_city-0 to show defiance against the NE_military-0 bomb of NE_country-0 .
this represent around -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the population of NE_city-0 .
the NE_country-0 central bank be state own and unlike bank in the west be now own by the elite or ridden by debt .
NE_person-0 didnt have to drive around in NE_country-0 with -CONST--0 inch thick glass or a tank like NE_person-1 do ,
search NE_publication-0 , theres plenty of video of him beign drive around wave and shake hand of the -CONST--0 of people run after him .
-CONST--0 year ago NE_world-region-0 leader all over the world praise him .
yes NE_person-0 have be accuse of some terrible thing , but look at the thing NE_world-region-0 leader do all of the time .
the second he start give out oil contract to NE_country-0 @/@ NE_continent-0 he be oust .
disgust .
ok , cool story , but here 's some fact :
1. he start a war in NE_country-0 - a crushingly poor nation that be in the middle of a civil war at the time - with the intent of establish a puppet NE_organization-0 that he could control .
thankfully he fail after NE_country-0 of NE_country-1 , expel his force .
2. he start this war in NE_country-0 by lure immigrant from NE_country-1 and poor sahelian nation to NE_country-2 with the promise of civilian work , and then press @-@ ganging them into fight as the NE_military-0 .
many legionnaires be still a major threat to peace and stability in NE_world-region-0 today , specifically in NE_country-region-0 where they be now know as the NE_military-0 .
perhaps you 've hear of them ?
3. he directly fund terrorism against the NE_country-0 in the form of the NE_military-0 , which he also train and equip , and sponsor other act of international terrorism such as the NE_city-0 bomb .
4. he embezzle -CONST--0 of dollar of public ENT_monetary-quantity-0 to fund a lavish , dictatorial lifestyle for him and his family .
5. he illegally proliferate nuclear weapon , chemical weapon and biological weapon in flagrant violation of international law .
6. any political dissent within NE_country-0 be brutally repress by the NE_military-0 , directly lead by NE_person-0 - one of his son , and compose of foreign mercenary willing to do anything against the -CONST--0 people for their next payslip .
7. NE_country-0 political refugee be assassinate by the state as a mean to oppress the opposition to his rule .
if you have any love lose for this man you be a terrible human be .
i think he do that to keep his people happy so that people would be less likely to oppose him or he start out good genuinely want to help his people but become obsess with power .
so vile .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can a country like the NE_country-0 , relatively liberal and tolerant , have such a powerful party of extremist ?
NE_country-0 have nothing to match the NE_political-party-0 , on social issue , apart from perhaps the NE_political-party-1 - but even they do n't hate on gay as much as the NE_political-party-2 do .
in -CONST--0 , ENT_amr-unknown-0 can NE_country-0 even think of vote in such a party ?
it 's disgust .
shame on the NE_political-party-0 .
it 's an incredibly religious country @- and a very evangelical one at that .
as much as i hate their attitude , you need to understand that it 's just the way they 've be bring up to think
that be say , it be still shock that this type of discrimination still exists...
the people who get involve in politics to the degree of go to debate be , thankfully , not representative of the majority of people over there .
do n't stop them be dick , though
and ? this be surprise ?
it 's know that the NE_country-0 be n't as progressive as NE_world-region-0 with regard to gay right and attitude towards gay people .
to be fair , NE_person-0 be probably just a confused idiot .
he say that sex have no place in the military and orientation be irrelevant , which i agree with .
but then he say he 'd bring dadt back , which be disagree with .
but the boo of the soldier be terrible make no mistake .
if a gay soldier be better than , or just as good as a straight soldier , then it make no difference what their sexuality be .
at the end of the day , if i be serve on the front line with other troop , i 'd want the best troop , not the straightest .
what make me laugh be that the usual anti @-@ NE_country-0 crowd have jump on this thread with all the " vile " and " disgust " comment .
the same crowd that get into a lather about the evil empire of NE_country-0 and the poor NE_country-1 blahblahblah .
the NE_country-0 have legalised gay marriage in some state , and federal equality law . sure , some people be n't up with that - but that 's freedom for you .
contrast this with the wonder of the palestinan authority , where it be a criminal offence to be gay and punishable by imprisonment .
you hear a lot of criticism of NE_country-0 - but if you have to , would you rather live there or -CONST--0 of -CONST--1 close neighbour ? bear in mind NE_country-1 's freedom , prosperity , etc.
note : i know some of the country do n't physically neighbour NE_country-0 , but they be extremely close so they count .
eygpt , probably because they 're comparitively level and calm . ( i say comparatively ) .
for religious , political and social freedom . NE_country-0
because it 's the most westernised , NE_country-0 .
i know a lot of NE_country-0 people and let me tell you , they 're the most fun love person i have ever meet .
really open @-@ mind and peaceful .
it look really beautiful too !
NE_country-0 because its the least likely country to get bomb and invade by -CONST--0
NE_country-0 or NE_country-1 .
plus to all the people say NE_country-0 , really ?
its future be very uncertain and NE_religious-group-0 ( assume some of you be ) be routinely not treat properly .
i really have no idea why -- unless you be a devout NE_religious-group-0 -- you would choose NE_country-0 over NE_country-1 .
unless you have no care for any of your freedom .
and before anyone make any sarcy comment about NE_country-0 , at least a woman can drive there..
none , when i be in NE_country-0 the heat be too annoy , so i 'd rather not reside in that region .
NE_country-0 . NE_city-0 be a relax , westernised place and the party capital of the NE_world-region-0
cyprus... ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
its only a little swim away i 'd call it a neighbor , live there for -CONST--0 year , lovely , go for a swim in the sea catch some ray on the saturday , then off to build a snowman on NE_mountain-0 on the sunday , great little island .
i see the news story about the submariner who went on a kill spree on a nuclear submarine and it worry me quite a bit .
be it realistic that in the next -CONST--0 year there 'll be worldwide dismantlement of all nuclear weapon intend for kill other human ?
never hopefully .
nuclear weapon have keep the world superpowers from wipe each other out
the submarine be just power by a nuclear reactor , it fire non nuclear warhead .
the day they 'll be get rid of be the day something more powerful be invent .
we have every reason to hope that do n't happen , tbh .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would ENT_government-organization-0 and company in certain country sell arm to an offensive country ENT_amr-unknown-1 they attack a country they dislike but then attack that country ENT_amr-unknown-2 it attack a country they do like
this be double standard !
i be talk about the NE_country-0 before and during the NE_war-0 .
NE_country-0 attack NE_country-1 then ENT_government-organization-0 were happy to sell weapon to NE_country-2 include NE_country-3 , NE_country-4 , NE_country-5 , NE_country-6 , NE_country-7 , NE_country-8 and NE_country-9 .
some of them be even sell to both side such as NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 .
a small minority sell only to NE_country-0 these be NE_country-1 and surprizingly NE_country-2 accord to NE_country-3 ( although NE_country-4 deny this ) .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would all these country be happy for NE_country-0 to go on the war path and to fund both all side of the war yet go after NE_country-1 when it start on NE_country-2 ( although they leave NE_person-0 in power ) .
my thought be that ENT_government-organization-0 simply let ENT_government-organization-1 private arm company make a bit of cash off the war like ENT_government-organization-2 usually do .
they use their puppet ENT_government-organization-0 of the shah and NE_person-0 to control the country to counter NE_country-0 influence in the region .
when the NE_religious-group-0 revolution happen the NE_country-0 lose all their influence over the nation so after NE_country-1 begin their attempt invasion they happily cast a blind eye in order to regain influence .
then when they see NE_person-0 invade country they already have influence in NE_country-0 they finally take action although they leave him in power as the NE_country-1 be still there and would n't want NE_country-2 to become communist .
then -CONST--0 year later there be no long a NE_country-0 but they notice a NE_country-1 that be a potential threat to their NE_country-2 so when some they get some ' evidence ' of NE_country-3 with nuclear material from a known unreliable source via NE_organization-0 they jump with joy to invade it .
it be a win win for their publicity they either take out evil dictator NE_person-0 or they stop NE_country-0 get nukes .
then they build up their base in NE_country-0 and fund a new ENT_government-organization-0 to counter the threat of NE_country-1 as they lose all influence upon NE_country-2 when they stop them in the NE_war-0 .
these war be just way to prevent other nation gain any sort of power whether it be directly or indirectly as well as make their arm company some major money on the side .
so if you still think the NE_country-0 and co be the just and honourable ENT_government-organization-0 they claim to be ENT_amr-unknown-0 would they allow company to fund -CONST--0 side of a war ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would they go to war over an ideology ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would they only take action when a puppet state be invade ?
well , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be you propose to replace it with ?
because ENT_government-organization-0 change every -CONST--0 year in most place and every ENT_government-organization-1 tend to pursue a different policy .
NE_person-0 sell gun to NE_person-1 and NE_person-2 help oust him , you can n't look at it as if NE_person-3 be bind or responsible for the action of NE_person-4
a country action should n't ( and luckily don't ) depend on moral standard .
it be naive to think they should .
there be far more important political and economical reason for military intervention or political sanction .
i certainly do n't , they 're mostly hypocrite .
if only we could make the leader look right into the eye of every civilian they kill , maybe the fight and war would stop .
obviously i know it never will , but i can dream .
there be so much discussion these day about race , muslims , etc that i get the feel there be underlie problem .
personally i feel sorry for them ( non white and NE_religious-group-0 ) as they bear the brunt of these discussion .
or be we just in denial of racial and ethnic problem in society ?
''learn from history'' - yes , and it teach us ''multiculturalism'' actually always fail .
i do however believe we could get along together , if we figure out how .
douchebags like this be give a forum to air their view be fan a lot of contagious stupidity
well this be the case no matter the denial .
its funny , when muslims plant bomb , the first thing people say be , ' ENT_amr-unknown-0 do they do this ? ', well , fair enough , because its better to understand motive , the same apply to the growth of nationalism in NE_continent-0 .
many factor be at play , anti white racism , immigrant crime which target white people disproportionally , mass invasion immigration policy , abuse of immigration and welfare system .
it be no use just blame ' racism ' as it miss the issue .
so everyone be just get along fine ,
regardless of race , religion , nationality and ethnicity etc ?
i do n't think that be true either
i 'm as right @-@ wing as they come , but ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the NE_country-0 keep hold of island that be not theirs ?
they be -CONST--0 of mile away .
i long for the day that the island be reunite with NE_country-0 and diplomatic relation between NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 can resume .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be your thought ?
when hell freeze over .
when the NE_island-0 islander decide they want to be NE_country-0 .
they be quite fond of be NE_country-0 right now .
be this another name for the NE_territory-0 ?
as i understand it , the inhabitant of these island feel a strong sense of britishness , and want to continue to remain NE_country-0 .
the island belong to the islander , not NE_country-0 , and if the islander say they want to be argentinian , or independent , then the island would cease to be british .
can you not understand the difference between an individual in one country want to be a citizen of another ( basically a wannabe migrant ) and a state wish to retain its territorial status ?
in your NE_country-0 example , that 's the difference between a dude in NE_country-1 say " i want to be NE_country-2 - ENT_amr-unknown-0 can n't i ? " and NE_state-0 say " we want to remain part of the NE_country-3 ".
that 's true ; the oil in the NE_territory-0 be not a major factor .
although i do believe that if the majority of islander wish to be NE_country-0 we should keep the NE_territory-0 .
when we get NE_country-0 ' back '.
i mean they in no way want to be part of the NE_country-0 , but they 're right next to us , so they should be...
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do the term ' NE_territory-0 ' even exist ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do n't i just call NE_country-0 ' dickhead land '.
also , NE_person-0 , ignorance much ?
they already belong to the NE_country-0 grant them local governance .
so technically they already belong to their owner .
they never be unite with NE_country-0
the problem with this logic be there be more than enough people who think differently to cover the cost - and they ( or anyone in fact ) could n't care less what you think .
they will be pay for the defence themselves if with the oil revenue as well so there will be even less reason for you to complain in the future .
i have to write about the NE_organization-0 involvement in current affair for school , i must have be live under a rock for the past few month because -CONST--0 have no idea at all as to what the NE_organization-1 involvment with NE_country-0 be , ive try to google it but all the different information be confuse me , can anyone explain -CONST--1 ?
they be call in when country fail to run their economy properly .
of course eurocrats fail to see ENT_amr-unknown-0 be happening... ENT_amr-unknown-1 do you expect from hansomly @-@ pay , non @-@ audit people resposible for other @-@ people 's money ?
like the fall of the NE_country-0 , the whole mess be gonna get worse .
in -CONST--0 NE_country-0 's cpi go up by -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-0 year @-@ on @-@ year , -CONST--2 ENT_percentage-entity-1 in city and -CONST--3 in rural area .
attention that the food price go up by an astonish -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 .
this be definitely increase the pressure on its economic growth .
everyone have his @/@ her point of view .
that 's only a percentage point higher than the NE_country-0 , but unlike us they have double digit economic growth so have plenty of room to work with .
i mean , if inflation be -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 but the economy grow -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 , that 's net wealth creation of -CONST--2 ENT_percentage-entity-2 be n't it ?
or be there something i 'm miss ?
even if the rate of economic growth almost double the rate of inflation , the effect of this high rate of inflation be still prominent ; especially due to NE_country-0 's very unequal distribution of wealth .
" -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 in city and -CONST--1 in rural area "
the rural area accomodate many of the peasant in NE_country-0 and as it face such high rise in food price and a -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 rise in general price , those peasant be go to find it increasingly hard to purchase their commodity .
i be sure many of us be well aware of NE_person-0 's " NE_theory-0 , that future conflict would be along cultural line between " west ", " east " and " confucian " block , whatever they be .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do everyone think ?
do the theory hold weight or be it just a product of modern day oriental @-@ ism ?
the NE_person-0 's mind be move in , in my opinion , the right direction .
conflict be almost always cause by political and economic issue rather than cultural one , even if motive for fight may ostensibly appear to be over religion , for example .
if you have NE_journal-0 access and have n't read NE_person-0 's article on NE_person-1 , then i recommend it .
something that caught my eye today .
it seem NE_country-0 be propose a ban on the cultivation and possession of a range of plant that contain certain psychoactive substance .
these be the plant that be already include in australias ban list :
- all plant in the cannabis genus
- all plant in the erythroxylum genus ( which cocaine be derived from )
- papaver somniferum and papaver bracteatum ( opium poppy )
- all fungi that contain psilocin and psilocybin ( magic mushroom )
these be the plant that would be add to the ban list :
- savia divinorum
- kratom
- khat
- brugmansia
- datura ( the former and latter both common garden flower , but be crap as recreational drug due to their high toxicity . idiot who try -CONST--0 -CONST--1 wont try it again , if they survive.)
- any plant that contain ephedrine
- any plant contain mescaline
- any plant contain dmt ( this be the one i find most absured as there be litterally -CONST--0 if not -CONST--1 of plant and tree that contain this substance , many grow wild in NE_country-0 and be commonly use in landscape .
dmt even occur naturally in human and most other mammal , be they go to ban human and mammal too ! ?)
as a horticulturalist myself , i find the NE_country-0 authority proposal to be highly disturbing .
this be completely pointless legislation , bureaucracy at its finest , that be go to criminalise potentially -CONST--0 of innocent people who work with these plant or grow them ornamentally in their garden .
and just ENT_amr-unknown-0 do they expect to be able to enforce a ban on litterally -CONST--0 of species of plant ?
its insanity , you cant legislate nature .
and then of course we come back to the old chesnut ; most of the substance in these propose plant be less harmful and addictive than legal substance , such as alcohol and tobacco .
mescaline and dmt actually cause less harm to the body than caffeine .
anyhoo , rant over .
this article be a few month old , so -CONST--0 dont know if this made it into the law book or if it be throw out , so if anyone have any information id like to hear about it .
heres hope common sense prevail for -CONST--0 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do they ban cannabis in NE_country-0 ?
dosent it grow as a....well wee
it 's your responsibility to use drug sensibly and your choice whether you abuse them or not .
it 's no right of the ENT_government-organization-0 or anyone to control what you consume .
i think the ENT_government-organization-0 should tackle drug use and damage life by provide support for those who need it , not by criminalising them .
many drug addict get send to prison and be give methadone to ' ease ' their addiction to crack , meth or heroin .
obviously that 's wrong .
=/ that 's the harsh reality of it .
ban the substance in the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 place .
it will cause damage now to those addict but better for long term
i do see the value of rehab though
it 's the illegality of drug that make the production , distribution and use of those drug hugely expensive and harmful to everyone .
most of the outlaw drug , if take with a bit of knowledge and awareness , be mostly as harmful , if not much less harmful , than tobacco or alcohol .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think of the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 -CONST--0 NE_political-party-0 debate on thursday ?
it feature NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 , NE_person-3 , and NE_person-4 .
it be in the early day , so there be n't that many candidate .
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think of the NE_broadcast-program-0 version of the ‘undeclared’ candidate 's debate .
it feature impression of NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 , NE_person-3 , NE_person-4 , and of course , NE_person-5 play by the legendary NE_person-6 !
i think it be great . pure humour .
edit : NE_person-0 be n't in either . hmm....
i like NE_person-0 more and more
NE_person-0 would support any mean to protect the country . not like the sound of that
the NE_broadcast-program-0 one seem to be let down by the fact that so many of the undeclared big name be n't there ( for the obvious reason that they 're undeclared ) .
NE_person-0 runner of those that take part , but the NE_broadcast-program-0 people be far more likely to be the main contender .
that say , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be NE_person-0 this time in the -CONST--0 race ?
notwithstanding a few of his religious nutter @-@ esque social view NE_person-0 be the only NE_political-party-0 who actually make sensible point about big government and the only one i have any respect for .
too bad he 's never go to be president give the state of the NE_political-party-0 .
i just see a similar thread on NE_country-0 , so i think , ENT_amr-unknown-0 not in NE_country-1 as well ?
i dont need to explain the situation there...... but shouldnt they have a revolution ?
the press be relatively free so people have a medium they can vent through .
there be too many faction that be fight amongst each other - if they unite under a common cause then there would be a serious threat of revolution .
firstly , NE_person-0 be not an enemy of ours .
secondly , NE_person-0 be the autocrat of his country , if he wish to stamp out rebellion , it 's his prerogative .
all state hold the right to defend their own interest .
human be cruel , people should get over it , it 's our nature .
additionally , should n't our own arm force be use for national defence only ?
of all of these conflict over the past -CONST--0 @-@ -CONST--1 year or so , which directly affect our interest :
- the falklands
- the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 NE_war-0 ( liberation of NE_country-0 )
- NE_country-0
- NE_country-0
- NE_country-0
- ENT_ordinal-entity-0 NE_war-0 ( removal of NE_person-0 )
i would say only the falklands .
the falklands the NE_war-0 and to an extent the NE_war-1 .
i see what your say but if we have a chance to help people fight for democracy and not be brutally crush then we should do something .
we rarely get the chance to support rebellion as in most case the rebel be as bad as the ENT_government-organization-0 they be fight .
NE_country-0 can be see as a popular uprise against a NE_person-0 .
no doubt people complain but they would complain if we do nothing to .
no one want to see another NE_country-0 and this event seem to signify a much more proactive right foreign policy from the NE_country-1 .
and before people shout oil at me .
well you be just go to have to wait until after this end be n't you to see if it be .
frankly i cannot imagine why company would negotiate oil contract only to try to convince the ENT_government-organization-0 to invade the country so they lose them .
take some of the responsibility for enforce a no fly zone ( i.e . patrol shoot down any plane which NE_person-0 use to bomb civilian ) would have be acceptable due to the NE_organization-0 resolution and the fact that civilian in NE_city-0 be sit duck .
however , bomb ground troop in order to allow arm rebel to rampage further west be , in my opinion , completely against the spirit of the NE_organization-0 resolution .
i increasingly get the impression that the coalition be not protect civilian ( i.e . unarm citizen , not rebel ) but rather be passively support the rebellion by decimate NE_person-0 's soldier who , at the end of the day , be just do what they be tell .
it 's easy to shout oil and the fact that it get shout so often mean that it 's also brush off by those support military action , without a thorough evaluation .
oil be not the only reason why the coalition be back the rebel ( and i 'm go to take the plunge now and say that they be ) , but it be certainly a consideration .
NE_person-0 have state that ( assume he regain control over his country ) he will only sell oil to the NE_country-0 and the NE_country-1 .
the rebel on the other hand have state that they be willing to upgrade oil production in NE_city-0 -CONST--0 @-@ fold .
people can argue that we be do our bit by help out the NE_country-0 in their time of crisis .
but ENT_amr-unknown-0 have n't we intervene in the numerous conflict in NE_continent-0 over the past -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 year
i agree that we should be help out all these innocent people ( im sure if it be the other way around we would want help from more powerful country )
but ENT_amr-unknown-0 there and not in other place ?
i do think our main reason for help be oil and resource , which be pretty much as bad as do nothing as we 're not set the example of help people out in a time of crisis , its more of a " we 'll help but only because we might get something in return "
i know this be just how the world work , but there would be alot less trouble in the world if it wasnt .
anybody who believe the NE_empire-0 , once again , intervene in yet another country on ' humanitarian ground ' to protect ' innocent civilian ' be absolutely ignorant of history and cannot use mere logic , or at least do not apply it to ' queen and country '.
or , they could be the opposite of independent thinker and accept the propaganda spout by the establishment .
if the rebel be NE_political-party-0 , the intervention lead by the NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 in NE_country-3 would not have occur , nor would the rebel opposition be support , have they be NE_political-party-1 .
in other word , the intervention in NE_country-0 be not about protect civilian , but instead entirely about protect interest and side with a candidate whom the ' coalition ' prefer .
if this be not the case , the NE_country-0 would be intervene exactly how NE_country-1 be today in NE_country-2 , even if the rebel have be the NE_criminal-organization-0 .
furthermore , NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 have always state from the very begin that they be willing to intervene in NE_country-2 without the approval of the NE_organization-0 .
yet the justification they keep use for this intervention be to ' enforce humanitarian law authorised by the NE_organization-0 '.
to be blunt while be honest...
history will show once again , that the real reason for this NE_organization-0 @-@ lead intervention in NE_country-0 be not about ' defend innocent people '.
and when it do , all those who support this intervention should be hold accountable for their ignorance and the crime of strengthen a system which have consistently prove , through its billion of dead victim , to be the greatest monster this world have ever see .
ok guy , we 've see how the egyptians successfully bring NE_person-0 down and at the same time theres also a lot of protest goin around the NE_world-region-0 country ; NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 etc.....
although it may not seem like it have nothing to do with religion , just politics...i feel like the world be come to an end or something cause muslims be finally take a stance for their rights....
after this , ENT_amr-unknown-0 next ?
be just wonder could there be an islamic revolution perhaps in the near future where the world be like come to an end ? ??
this be probably a really stupid question but just give me some feedback about this matter
the answer be no.
guys..i know its a bit tedious but im just wondering..
if you guy can be bother than dont bother read it then !
god willing , yes , if only to overthrow the corrupt ENT_government-organization-0 in place in these country .
none of these protest be NE_religious-group-0 in nature .
they tend to be secular leaderless and make u mostly of the young .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be wrong with muslims speak up for their right ? ??
explain yourself .
and as far as an NE_religious-group-0 revolution be concern i would say that it depends on ENT_amr-unknown-0 organize religious or clerical organization be in a country and ENT_amr-unknown-1 politicized they be .
any analysis on the issue can n't be a -CONST--0 size fit all jacket since the nature of the protest vary in all say country .
it apeas noth NE_country-0 have start enrich uranium at a brand new plant that apparently be very modern .
seem odd they could build this . im bet on a lot of NE_country-0 maybe even NE_country-1 help .
it would appear they be go to ake more nukes .
ok so ENT_amr-unknown-0 be your thought on this ?
are they a danger ?
will this change anything ?
could we see a much more aggressive NE_country-0 ?
or will nothing change ?
i very much doubt NE_country-0 would be involve in this .
NE_country-0 be sympathisers with the communist regime so possibly link there .
there 's very little anyone can do about it because bomb their nuclear facility will result in NE_city-0 be obliterate and most of NE_country-0 be destroy without nukes .
the only hope be if dear leader 's son allow change but do n't hold your breath .
hey guy , read the news ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , -CONST--0 can n't help but notice that occasionally , the NE_world-region-0 media ( NE_company-0 and sometimes NE_company-1 ) picture NE_country-0 as a country who be heartless , have no respect for human right , dictatorship etc.etc .
however , this past summer , i go to NE_country-0 for holiday , and it be nothing like the NE_world-region-0 media picture it to be , the people all seem to enjoy life , no sign of human right abuse ( i traveled to NE_province-0 to , the people seem happy ) .
i can n't help but feel that the NE_world-region-0 media be portray only one side of the story ( NE_province-0 ) ,when in reality we brits have also invade NE_province-1 and the world say nothing .
i see that we be afraid of a communist country rise , and i know they be n't the nicest people , but neither be we when we colonize -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 of the world , or when the NE_country-0 drive the indians off their land .
are we right to be complain about NE_country-0 when we do n't have a clean record either ?
do you think that the NE_world-region-0 media be demonizing NE_country-0 ?
as a westerner , do you think NE_country-0 be a cold , heartless dictatorship ?
i 'm half chinese and the NE_world-region-0 media be definitely demonizing NE_country-0 .
the NE_country-0 ENT_government-organization-0 have more support from ENT_government-organization-1 people than the NE_country-1 government do .
when the NE_world-region-0 criticize NE_country-0 about its lack of democracy of human right abuse it 's usually only the NE_world-region-1 who have a problem with -CONST--0 and not the average chinese person .
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 be these clown always complain about NE_province-0 ?
the fact that they do n't care about uyghurs just show what hypocrite and bigot they be .
that 's because whenever a NE_country-0 person do complain they get thrown in prison or shot .
NE_country-0 's record on human right be appal look at the -CONST--0 child policy that be cause major gender imbalance problem as well as be brutally implement , force sterliseation and such .
although i do n't criticise it on democracy as democracy be always right or good .
as for the more popular than the NE_country-0 ENT_government-organization-0 source ?
the media demonoising NE_country-0 be just what the media do , it demonises everything its how they sell paper with horror story .
even if they get nukes NE_country-0 be still heavily outmanned , outgunned and isolate .
their nukes wont be as good as american and european nukes .
their uav 's wont be as good as isreali and american uav 's
their missile will barley cross their own border before they be shot down by a multitude of defence the NE_country-0 have already be prepare in the NE_world-region-0 for the past god know ENT_amr-unknown-0 long .
the only thing the extremist muslims can possibly do be blow themselves up in our border .
and they have fail that more than enough time .
NE_country-0 threat .
NE_country-0 with nukes however will unify and strengthen the resolve and moral of the muslims
NE_country-0 want to portray itself as the ' hero ' of the muslims against the NE_world-region-0 infidel by have nukes and defy the NE_country-1 .
so the more we talk about it , the more coveradge they get and the more muslim extreamists will orgasm at the sound of NE_country-0 's threat .
so let ignore NE_country-0 be like the kid in primary school with the attention seek problem .
meh maybe if the came clean with their nuclear program and would accept help that the rest of the world be offer .
if they be so peaceful ENT_amr-unknown-0 not allow NE_organization-0 inspector in .
the problem be n't that they could potentially outmatch us in term of nuclear capability .
the problem be that its monstrous regime will become more stable , and will be able to dictate the rest of the world 's policy towards it .
plus , one must consider the potential ramification of thermonuclear weapon fall into the hand of a regime run by the clergy ; a clergy that have repeatedly lay claim to the island nation of NE_country-0 , support NE_person-0 's thuggish militia in NE_country-1 , make continual reference to the apocolypse and the return of the ' ENT_ordinal-entity-0 imam ', and so on .
that 's without go into how it will make a complete mockery of international law and non @-@ proliferation .
NE_country-0 should become a republic when NE_person-0 die , prime minister NE_person-1 have say just day ahead of a general election .
NE_country-0 @-@ NE_person-0 say the queen 's death would be an " appropriate point " for NE_country-1 to move away from have a NE_country-2 monarch as head of state .
NE_country-0 vote against become a republic in a -CONST--0 referendum , but the issue continue to be divisive .
so , ENT_amr-unknown-0 think NE_country-0 would vote for a republic ?
it 's up to them if they wish to sever the bond that unite their heritage , history , and present .
i do n't think the issue be that they have a hereditary monarch , but the fact that the hereditary monarch in question be a ' foreign ' one ( yes , i be aware she be queen of NE_country-0 in her own right , but you know what i mean ) .
i think they should keep the monarchy...
the monarchy exist here for the same reason it do over there .
heritage , history and present , as the above poster rightly say .
it 's not a drain on their economy and their power and sovereignty be n't be control in real political term .
i do , however , agree with the propose flag change , if that 's what NE_country-0 want .
hold another referendum !
are we witness a new era of repression .
in the past nation would develop new technology to dominate its rival , however with recent attempt to prevent NE_country-0 from develop nuclear technology be we see powerful nation use economic terrorism ( sanction ) and war to prevent other nation from develop technology to compete .
for a nation with civilian and military nuclear technology to essentially deny another nation the same right to develop technology it be clear that the old guard of westenr power be try to prevent emerge power from develop the same level of technology .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can NE_country-0 stake its claim to its right ?
economic terrorism ( sanction ) be essentially a way to ruin an economy its a modern day version of a seige and an act of war .
the sanction place on NE_country-0 be design to appear to target only military group but with research you will see it massively target civilian business , infrastructure and even the attempt of iranian student to study outside of NE_country-1 .
this be an all out attempt to cut of irans blood flow and crush this nation .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 should other nation learn from this ?
other develop nation would be wise to realise that NE_world-region-0 power have a stake in prevent the development of nation they consider inferior particularly NE_continent-0 , NE_continent-1 and NE_continent-2 nation .
this realisation should make them realsie they must band together to defeat this racist threat .
i would suggest an economic block and the share of nuclear technology within this block to ensure their sovereignty from both military and economic war .
NE_country-0 have a vest interest in keep certain nation poor and weak but with solidarity and strength these nation can rise up and defy this evil threat .
hmm here be a country that generally do n't like me should i let them build a big nuclear weapon they can kill me with ?
*thinks hard*
iran will get destroy by the israelis before it have a chance to get a nuclear weapon , and if israel be unable to do so then the NE_country-0 race would be ( excuse the pun ) exterminate .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can you be in favour of this ?
you make it out like hamper a nation development be somthing new !
since the dawn of civilization country and province have sort do out do each other and gain from others weakness .
you say it be crazy that NE_country-0 force sanction on NE_country-1 , yet it be not in their economic or defence interest to allow this to happen so in fact it be perfectly sane .
if NE_country-0 be to develop nuclear weapon , they would use them , and they would , theoretically , become the powerhouse in the NE_world-region-0 .
this be against NE_country-0 forgien policy for -CONST--0 reason , firstly they need to secure the safty of the oil field in the NE_world-region-0 , and secondaly an anti @-@ NE_world-region-1 superpower in the NE_world-region-2 will more likely that not attract the back of NE_country-1 , who already have make it perfeclty clear that they be inforcing their dominance over NE_continent-0 .
the combination of an NE_country-0 @-@ NE_country-1 block in NE_continent-0 and NE_continent-1 would seriously threatern the NE_country-2 and the whole NE_world-region-0 world .
thus , it be just and need for the NE_country-0 to impose such sanction on NE_country-1 .
if NE_person-0 do say this , do he have any info as to ENT_amr-unknown-0 be gonna go down ?
do you think the americans will strike other me country in the run up to the NE_country-0 attack or simulataneously strike ?
could be NE_country-0 perhaps ?
just hope we do n't get drag into this war ; we can n't even deal with the taliban...
let the american @/@ israelis deal with it !
there 's nothing about it on the NE_organization-0 , but yes , a strike be inevitable .
i highly doubt the NE_country-0 @/@ NE_country-1 will strike any other NE_world-region-0 country , in fact , i cannot see it happen whatsoever .
the NE_country-0 will do exactly as the NE_country-1 say because of this idiotic perception that both of our nation share a ' special relationship '.
the NE_country-0 will be drag into it , you can bet your bottom dollar on that .
substantial evidence have be present to prove large quantity of deplete uranium ( du ) have be use in NE_country-0 since the invasion in -CONST--0 .
[edit] ok since alot of people think the ' NE_publication-0 ' be untrustworthy i will give another source which give the same information about NE_person-0 's statement .
i can n't bring myself to understand this in any way .
i remember see some picture of deformity a little while back and could n't even believe it be humanly possible .
they disturb for a few day after and that 's from someone who be n't easily upset .
back then i always believe that the leader of our militaries would never allow this .
they would never allow generation of NE_country-0 's to suffer from mutation and deformity like these .
i pass it off as propaganda at the time but now the evidence seem substantial and clear that this be exactly what happen .
what be the most upset be that our tax fund this .
our tax cause girl to be born with -CONST--0 head like something straight out of a horror film .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can this ever be rectify ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can you explain to the children why they be born with paralyse limb or be born with their eye form inside out ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can you rectify a system ENT_amr-unknown-1 have do to iraq what it 's do over the decade .
from support tyrant , to watch on and do nothing , to several large scale war , to cripple sanction .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 harm be they afraid of from these ordinary , poor NE_country-0 .
you can n't rectify .
that 's ******* disgust and i hope the perpertrators be make to suffer what generation of NE_country-0 's already have and will ever endure .
remember those who champion themselves on human right be actually the biggest terrorist in the world .
certain place like NE_city-0 , NE_city-1 , NE_city-2 atc , baathi scum stronghold deserve it for what they do to NE_country-0 and the iraqi people under NE_person-0 's( may NE_person-1 curse him ) regime .
that 's ******** for a start the NE_country-0 would not a shell a town with du , it 's high density mean it be use for penetrator core for armour pierce sabot round , to be use against tank .
it 's a kinetic energy round and would serve no purpose other than in a pitched tank battle , of which there be n't that many in gw2 .
and that 's the NE_publication-0 article , i do n't even need to bother try to discredit something from the ' NE_publication-1 '.
well that 's war be n't it ?
never like it but when war happen you have to expect any atrocity .
they want to sue the NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 ?
it be a ******* war we would be stupid to give them money because they will only use it for weaponry to fight against our arm force and they will probably plant some du in our country or even nuke us innocent civillians for payback .
sure we all want war to be just and we all think nothing like this should happen , but you 'd be naive to think this be possible and this be how a war should be conduct .
it 's a ******* war .
do n't tell me muslim country like NE_country-0 and pre @-@ war NE_country-1 would n't invoke such method if they could .
apology for be so inevitably stupid but...j am i wrong in think superpowers be judge by their worth , their gdp ?
if so , ENT_amr-unknown-0 can NE_country-0 overtake the NE_country-1 even as it grow in this area ?
it be still way off the NE_country-0 gdp .
i know the NE_country-0 have a lot of debt , and a great deal of it be owe to NE_country-1
also , be n't NE_country-0 ahead of NE_country-1 in term of gdp ?
when you have 1 billion+ people , its almost impossible not to become a super power...even if your army be fight with sword and bows....cos it simply be n't possible to win against the sheer amount of number
true , thank for that .
but it 's not like their population swell overnight , or be it ?
i 'm just try to find out more about the subject really..
imo : grow military strength , economic potential and influence in international affair make a superpower .
its their industry , cheap labour , huge workforce , investment in technology and hard work nature .
NE_country-0 be invest in the future , we here in NE_country-1 really be not...
NE_country-0 be go for it headlong and because of this be develop more and more and discover new thing .
NE_country-0 also have less strict law on what not to do...i.e they will test and fund thing that we have regulation against .
they have huge industry which they dont care much in the way of climate problem .
they have a massive population ready for any dirty job .
finally , they be a hard work people with dedication and less slobby
do we really want another superpower ?
compare to the others , NE_country-0 look like a bunch of savage : disgust human and animal right record and a lack of freedom .
the gdp be rapidly rise each year .
lol @- NE_country-0 's economy be less than half the size of NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 's and almost half as small as the NE_country-3 's .
couple with the fact that the country have just be through a huge reccesion that have wipe off more than -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of its gdp , and that it be fall to piece through political instability , i think im right to say its a joke @- not to mention the fact that its entire economy be based around export natural resource that will soon run out .
it also worth mention that as soon as conventional oil reserve run out , the NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 will have by far the biggest reserve in the world in the form of oil shale etc.
did you just refer to information from NE_publication-0 in your argument ?
and some be sort of mutually intelligble .
they all share the same write language though which i reckon distinguish from most other language .
worthy enough of call each sub @-@ language a dialect i 'd say .
NE_country-0 already be a super power ; NE_country-1 monetary policy be practically dictate by NE_country-2 .
if they want to crap all over the $ they could do it on a whim - no other country on the planet have the ability to do so , let alone devalue their currency to such an extent it make their export look ridiculously cheap .
NE_country-0 in the global market .
it be a superpower without question .
however to be a super @-@ power you do n't strictly have to be a develop economy .
NE_country-0 be decade from be as developed as the NE_country-1 , regardless of the amount of ENT_monetary-quantity-0 they have - chinas greatest compromise be time .
major city be much closer to their NE_world-region-0 counterpart , however it be beyond where the issue lie in NE_country-0 push as a credible economic entity .
what... so because i referred to NE_publication-0 somehow my argument be null and void ?
seriously get a clue .
-CONST--0 get a few chinese people tell me that NE_country-0 will be #1 in the future .
a few year back , NE_magazine-0 publish article about NE_country-0 's become the next big thing .
hard to tell but anything be possible .
i bet NE_country-0 have no idea they 'd be perish in the late 80 s @-@ early 90 s .
like some people say this in thread , NE_country-0 won't allow it .
NE_country-0 want to be the only example that represent democracy ( NE_country-1 be replace with democratic system , etc ) .
because NE_country-0 be a communist country , it would be harder for them to influence other country politically like how NE_country-1 britian influence its idea to different region of the world ( NE_country-2 in language , NE_city-0 in legal structure and language , etc ) .
-CONST--0 @-@ -CONST--1 year be a very long ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , i 'm not deny that NE_country-0 have potential and could potentially become the most powerful country in the world .
notice the world could in bold , some people would argue that if it continue this growth it would become the world 's most powerful country , both economically and militarily even i can see that , but the NE_country-0 will inevitably interfere , because it simply do n't want competition , it want to remain be the biggest , baddest dude on the block , and with NE_country-1 arrive on the world stage( i.e the new kid on the block ) there 'll inevitably and undoubtably be confrontation .
-CONST--0 think NE_country-0 will become the world 's ENT_ordinal-entity-0 largest economy - perhaps even the largest , i think NE_country-1 will become very strong militarily - perhaps not as strong as the NE_country-2 as it be light year behind , but still strong , perhaps even stronger than all of NE_continent-0 combine without the use of nukes .
do i think NE_country-0 will become a NE_country-1 type superpower ?
mean that -CONST--0 economy and military be both -CONST--1 time stronger than everyone elses - no i do n't , as i 've point out in my previous post , there 'll NE_country-0 will inevitably want to become the regional power of NE_continent-0 , it 'll want to do some land @-@ grab of its own( NE_country-1 for example ) which will lead to its demise .
well i think NE_country-0 's only real crime have be defy NE_country-1 energy interest in the region .
we see what happen last time iran defy the us in 1953 under mossadegh , and the result be a NE_government-organization-0 coup to put in someone who would happily bleed their NE_country-0 dry of NE_country-1 resource .
the NE_country-0 have only themslefes to blame for the move to the theocratical tyranny we see now , and most people would agree NE_country-1 pose no global threat , but NE_world-region-0 propaganda represent NE_country-2 as some nuclear threat have n't be based on NE_organization-0 report or reason , but as the crescent of the ' axis of evil ',that be those who dare to step out of line .
all road be point towards an attack of some sort .
whether this be jump on the back of a popular revolution , or air strike , who know , but one be for sure ; an attack would have serious implication , and not just the further destablisation of the region .
i do n't think either the NE_country-0 or the NE_country-1 tick the box for me .
neither gain significant land , neither won any significant war ( indeed , the most famous war NE_country-0 be involve in post NE_war-0 be NE_war-1 , which they flunk ) - hardly characteristic of a traditional superpower .
superpowers tend to make huge stride in better the life of human civilisation ( the NE_country-0 do it by further democracy , the NE_country-1 empire do it with the industrial revolution ) .
the NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 certainly do n't make any groundbreaking revolution .
these -CONST--0 country be best know for stockpile weapon and race to the moon - not characteristic of be a superpower .
they have the potential military might to rival classic superpowers , but time have change so much that it be just never go to happen .
my professor raise this point this morning in class :
" -CONST--0 and -CONST--1 of year ago , my family live in NE_country-0 , in a consequent town where there be family like mine , make a little clan .
we be then chase from NE_country-0 , because we be invade by norwegians say that we be stranger , while it have be our land for century and century , and we could n't be consider as stranger .
do you ( ask the class ) think that nowadays , i could go back to NE_country-0 , and chase the people live there , with the only argument that my family live there for -CONST--0 of year ?
bear this in mind , do you think that israelians 's motif for go back to their land be sufficient ? "
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think of it ?
be he racist , or be he realistic ?
to be honest if NE_country-0 be the center of his religious belief and if he have be persecute all the year after his family get kick out he would have a different view .
more importantly he be NE_religious-group-0 - and he be rule by NE_religious-group-1 ENT_government-organization-0 .
plus if you look at it from his point of view .
conquest determine land hold .
his family be in NE_country-0 , they get conquer and so cease to own the land .
well the NE_ethnic-group-0 that use to live in NE_country-0 get ' conquer ' per se - although a much more benign version of conquest - and so no matter what the original motive for the conquest be , they lose the right to that land .
he be neither racist nor realistic - just wrong .
well , be they ?
i 'm use extremist lightly , i 'm just use the word as something to categorize them .
as in group like bnp , NE_political-party-0 and extremist muslims or any partly aggressive religion , could they all be count as bad as each other ?
they can all inspire hate , change story and have radical @/@ controversial view .
so could they be deem on the same level ?
NE_government-organization-0 exterminate jews...
extremist muslism would liek to convert everyoen else...
and NE_political-party-0 just want to deport foreigner elsewhere...
so no not really .
hate ( although i believe broadly be a bad thing ) be something i can live with...
change story ?
if you mean lie , then yes that be bad
radical @/@ controvesial be n't bad because they 're radical , they 're bad because of the belief itself .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 ? ENT_amr-unknown-1 do the public @/@ media favour NE_religious-group-0 country over NE_ethnic-group-0 one ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 have the NE_religious-group-0 ever do compare to NE_religious-group-1 ?
i mean come on...this seriously baffle me .
the NE_public-institution-0 be biased against NE_country-0 , and therefore NE_country-1 .
it 's not really about muslims vs . jews .
this be not true at all .
during the recent attack on NE_local-region-0 by NE_country-0 the NE_public-institution-0 be the only channel to not broadcast an appeal for the innocent muslims of NE_local-region-1 . even though all other channel do .
they seem to do pretty much the opposite of what you be say .
discuss
only way you have peace be by have a larger stick than the enemy ,
i prefer the u.s to NE_country-0 all the power to say a unstable country like NE_country-1 .
rock on u.s.a free NE_country-0 !
no point in discuss this .
i would say ' no ' but they have nuclear weapon and no @-@ one be go to take them away from them .
disclaimer : i be really not an expert on NE_country-0 politics .
so , as well as the presidential election yesterday , NE_country-0 voter could also vote on a lot of state @-@ specific proposition , one of which be NE_state-0 's proposition -CONST--0 .
gay marriage have be legal in NE_state-0 since -CONST--0 , but this proposition be in favour of eliminate the right of gay couple to marry .
it pass .
i be wonder if anyone have any thought on this..
i think its terrible .
they should n't be allow to do an about turn like that for no apparent reason , especially give the fact that it only recently become allow .
they could have at least give it a chance ENT_ordinal-entity-0 .
it 's just even more of a shame that , at a time when NE_country-0 appear to be turn a new leaf , there 's still so many people with this frame of mind .
it just really bug me that it get turn round so soon as well..
gay couple should be allow the happiness that marriage may bring , just like straight couple .
they should have just keep it legal and let those who disagree have a grumble and grind their teeth over it all - it 's not like they 're suffer .
this suprised me to be honest , NE_state-0 have always be know as one of the more progressive state in the NE_country-0 .
the law will probably jump back and forth in the come ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
NE_state-0 have a huge NE_religious-group-0 population which obviously reject it , not help by the large influx of migrant s @-@ NE_continent-0 NE_religious-group-1 into the state .
okay yes , true , they be allow .
which do mean people have the right to do them .
but i think the issue of the right to marry be different because people work to get the right and to change the law for it to be allow .
it be n't just a right because no one have tell them they could n't do it , like your example .
i think the issue here be not whether marriage be a right , but whether everyone should be consider equal .
either everyone have the right to marry , or no one do .
just as nobody have the ' right ' to murder ( which quite frankly i find to be a weak argument due to reason already mention ) , either nobody should have the right to marry , or everybody should .
that 's all there be to it .
i would argue that any law that i judge to be unjust be inherently illegitimate and thus i have no moral obligation to follow it or consider it to be a moral principle , nor would i use it to guide my decision make in any more than potentially in a practical sense .
i certainly could not and will not respect the rule of law when it impose restriction on -CONST--0 consent adult express their love , and quite frankly i think that such unjust law undermine the whole system .
you say you have n't consider prisoner not have the vote , and hypothesised that a good reason might be because they should have their right remove for commit a crime .
and the incest argument be entirely relate . if -CONST--0 people be happy together , why can n't they get marry ?
you want -CONST--0 rule for all , stand by what you say , instead of dodge the uncomfortable reality that even you 're not happy with everybody have the same right .
it force school to teach same @-@ sex marriage as a morally equal alternative , cal NE_state-0 the rest of NE_country-0 be full of religious people and they do not see this as right .
it will only take away the right for same @-@ sex couple to call it marriage , everything else be still there .
well , you 're sort of right ; we 're all be treat as ENT_ordinal-entity-0 class citizen , but you sort of miss the point .
right have be take away in both instance .
the moral outrage ( here , anyway ) associate with one have not be associate with the other simply because one be acceptable and one be n't ; so it 's not the fact that a right have be take away be wrong , its that you think x should have a right and that right have be take away so you 're annoy .
incidentally ; if you 're white , female , black , communist , jewish , whatever ; you can still not get marry if you 're gay .
if marriage be define as a man and a woman then ban gay marriage be perfectly legitimate .
my point still stand : if you need a certificate from the state to live your life in happiness then you be a.) a pathetic individual and b.) a serf .
so much for the change in NE_country-0
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be people go to realise that sexual orientation , skin colour and ethnicity have no bear on what be inside the person and their personality .
as long as you a good person , regardless of anything else then that be all that matter .
shame on NE_state-0 - it show what the real attitude on homosexuality be .
people pretend to be fine with it - but their be ignorance deep inside .
what a sad day for " new " NE_country-0 . it seem while racism be rightly widely condemn there be still a lot of homophobia around .
the sad thing be not that many seem to care
personally , i think they should have leave it ( ENT_amr-unknown-0 care about homosexual get marry ? ) but it 's quite common in the NE_country-0 for thing that become law by virtue of court decision to later be subject to public vote .
this be -CONST--0 such case .
gay marriage be never legislate for in NE_state-0 .
this proposition - approve by the public - trump a court decision .
i be read an article about how we need more black sold model for young black people to aspire to .
because apparently , all young black in britain need an extra reminder not to commit crime and be involve in gang .
this highlight a severely racist phenomenon that be consider completely acceptable .
that all these initiative be exclusively targeting young black NE_country-0 people ( in attempt to curb the apparent swarm of exclusively black teenager beg to be part of a gang ) while completely ignore any other skin colour .
now obviously not every black male want to go commit crime all day , and the evidence suggest that black like commit crime just as little as other skin colour do .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 the disproportionate representation in the media and in crime prevention strategy ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do nobody care about crime in the NE_world-region-0 , the NE_continent-0 or ( god forbid ) the white community ?
why be nobody say ENT_amr-unknown-0 great a role NE_model-0 be for all the young white kid grow up in council estate .
you can go anywhere in NE_country-0 and see that gang culture and criminal exist everywhere , in every ethnic group .
logic would dictate that a white orient initiative would make the most sense for demographic reason .
or how about something which do not base its case on skin colour and ethnic origin ?
do people really think that a poor white teenager do n't need support , encouragement or aspiration ?
i completely agree with everything you 've say .
i also think it 's this ridiculous idea that crime in certain ethnic group need to be deal with more urgently that cause more problem .
if the ethnicity and colour of those commit crime be n't mention , it would be much less big a deal . ENT_amr-unknown-0 this country feel the need to consistently talk about the colour of people be beyond me .
it 's like ENT_amr-unknown-0 we beg for NE_continent-0 @/@ black police officer .
if they do n't want to do it , they won't .
we should be judge on our merit , not our skin colour .
i believe it 's thing like this that make white people believe the country be go against them .
if the ENT_government-organization-0 do n't deal with thing only to do with race , then i , perhaps naively and idealistically , believe that it would become less of a big deal .
in NE_city-0 , black commit a disproportionate amount of crime .
hence , why they 're targeted .
most gang in NE_city-0 be full of black .
black role model give black people hope .
it 's not about whether it should or why do it , it just do because black community be a semi @-@ community .
totally agree .
poor white people ( pre -CONST--0 th century , just poor people ) have be discriminate against for -CONST--1 of year in NE_country-0 .
immigration happen and we 're suddenly part of the oppress class ?
grow up poor and white in a mostly non white school be horrible .
have to learn about the evilness of white people repeatedly really do n't give white kid the impression that they have a place in our multicultural society .
the reason specific ethnic group be targeted for try to reduce crime be because , for whatever reason , crime overall be often higher statistically in these group .
this be not because their race or culture be wrong or bad in any way , it 's simply a fact that certain group have higher rate of crime .
whether it 's the result of poverty or cultural difference and stress in NE_country-0 that be leave them vulnerable to get lure into crime , pretend that a group that have more prevalence for crime have n't be just foolish .
i do n't know the statistic , but if black youth be the target of an anti @-@ crime and role @-@ model drive , then it 's probably because they have a higher crime rate than other group , and because the ENT_government-organization-0 want to make sure that whatever factor it be ( because ENT_government-organization-1 know it 's not their race itself ) be address so they can have a better future .
and there be scheme targeting white population , but ENT_amr-unknown-0 there be an imbalance between ethnic group , it surely have to be a priority to address ENT_amr-unknown-1 be cause this -CONST--0 for nothing else then for the sake of equality !
there 's a lot of talk recently about ENT_amr-unknown-0 diversity be necessary , but ENT_amr-unknown-1 far do we go ?
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 do we judge ENT_amr-unknown-1 be a good and strong @/@ positive multiracial country ?
when you look at other NE_world-region-0 country like NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 , the vast majority of -CONST--0 immigrant be not white these day and be probably head for a more diverse future , so much so to the point that these nation will have very different demographic look to them in -CONST--1 year ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
they will have great brag right you could say when it come to multiracialism and diversity than NE_country-0 or most european country will maybe not have .
you often here quote like " NE_organization-0 be too white " " the tories be too white " but ENT_amr-unknown-0 define ENT_amr-unknown-1 be " too white "?
so i 'm wonder if people could put NE_country-0 in the same context ?
like i say people brand multiracialism as a good thing , very few want to go back to a -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 white society but ENT_amr-unknown-0 multiracial do we need to go to satisfy the vast majority of people , particularly liberal ?
i personally think it 's completely necessary but i know many of my opponent will disagree .
are we still not multiracial enough compare to some of our NE_world-region-0 rival ? ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think ? ?
mate you be all confuse .
when people say " the tories be too white " or " NE_organization-0 be too white "
what they mean be " the amount of white people in the tories be disproportionately represent compare to the british population ".
i.e. -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the british population be non @-@ white , but -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 of the tories be not correspondingly non @-@ white .
there be a bias in representation .
this be bad because it mean certain race be be exclude .
this be completely different to ask whether an entire nation population should be a certain skin colour - skin colour should be irrelevant .
it 's absolutely sicken you would want to diminish a race 's presence just for the sake of it .
the question be pretty , well , questionable
i do n't know of many people who want diversity for diversity 's sake .
the issue with place like " white " NE_organization-0 be the glass ceiling that keep minority and women out , as there be the feel ( whether true or not ! ) that there be not a level and fair play field .
funny how people come up with imaginary argument from the " other side ", as i 've never hear any of these " liberal " you refer to .
i think , as usual , you 're frame an argument in a way that will make your so call opinion look bad
if a memeber of your family be go an illegal activty would you conact the police about their action ?
obviously that depends on the activity .
i 'm not go to report my mate for drive at -CONST--0 on the motorway but if i suspect he be a serial killer i might be incline to tell somebody
i do n't know if contact the police would be the rationale approach .
i think i would personally confront that family memeber .
if i be unsuccessful i 'd get other family member to help and ultimately if they still refuse to listen -- i 'd leave them to their own accord and let them do what -CONST--0 belive be right or wrong .
because at the end of the day , my conscious would be clear [in the sense that i do try and help them].
tell the police would not be wise , as you 'd be create enemy .
it 'd depend ENT_amr-unknown-0 they be do .
if i do n't think they be harm anyone ( smoke dope , illegally downloading music etc ) then i would n't report them ; if they be hurt other people ( violent crime , theft from individual etc ) then i definitely would .
same go for anyone i be aware of commit a crime , tbh .
i would n't go ' ooh , you 've murder -CONST--0 people with an axe , but you 're my mum so i won't tell anyone '
the main argument i hear about this issue be that this country be ' full ' or that there 's enough unemployment as it be .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 exactly make people feel that NE_country-0 people deserve to remain in this NE_country-1 more than anyone else ENT_amr-unknown-1 just happen to have be born into poverty or war ?
surely if we 're all equal then no matter where one 's born , they have equal right to live in the NE_country-0 as someone born here .
i 'm not against immigration but i think it should be more regulate .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 ? because immigration have already cause a lot of " social issue " and until we solve those problem i do n't think its good to just let everyone in .
how should it work : education of NE_language-0 , their intention , and to what they will contribute and most importantly their ideology and belief .
to those whom the welfare state be the biggest concern i think the problem arise from the fact that there be already too many english people sponge off the state and if we add anymore people be it immigrant or " britons " our state of ENT_government-organization-0 would collapse and then our economy .
because i wish to protect diversity .
if immigration level be too high , the indigenous population ' gene pool will eventually become so dilute to essentially be extinct .
the cultural and genetic distinction that make the world a diverse , vary and interesting place will be lose , forever .
so that mean that in contrast to the general population they be actually slightly under represented therefore the NE_government-organization-0 do not rely on immigrant as much as leftie NE_thing-0 user claim they do .
well certainly in NE_city-0 they be here .
but to be honest if you live in a village like NE_city-0 , anywhere in the south west of NE_country-0 , or anywhere as a matter of fact in the rest of the NE_country-1 , all you will find be white , but in NE_city-1 you will find ethnic people
besides this be from -CONST--0 , i 'm pretty sure that the figure would be different now .
correct me if i 'm wrong .
the data be nearly -CONST--0 year old .
your point that this show that there be n't as many immigrant in the nhs as people think be surely not prove by that data - immigrant can be white e.g. immigrant from NE_country-0 or NE_country-1 would be count under the white statistic .
all i see on thestudentroom these day be agitate non @-@ muslims interrogate muslims , criticising their religion ( as any sane person would ) , muslims sign up to NE_website-0 just to post some anti @-@ NE_country-0 propaganda to persuade people about how evil NE_country-1 be or how NE_religious-group-0 be the religion of peace
it seem that the blood libel rumour of medeival time that NE_religious-group-0 kill NE_religious-group-1 baby to use their blood for wine be today in the form of zionists/jews/israelis kill palestinian baby just because theyre pure evil , and i think the islamic propaganda machine be succeed in convince people ?
anything which take side against muslims get a million negs - its obvious muslims be in a huge presence on tsr .
with a quarter of all primary school children from ethnic minority ( mainly islamic ) be the race @-@ relation and religious demography of thestudentroom a sign of thing to come on a national scale in britain ?
from tsr to a national scale be a pretty big jump do n't you think .
also this be a forum where topic be go to be discuss and these be categorised e.g. religion .
so you have a choice in view these thread and not be part of this so call propaganda .
also in my opinion there be more atheist than muslims on tsr .
and what have NE_religious-group-0 , zionists and NE_country-0 get to do with NE_religious-group-1 ?
finally " a quarter of all primary school children be muslim ".
i 've be threaten by countless of them on here .
generally they need positive feedback all the time , eithewise they get really agressive .
most of them be racist in my opinion .
agree , if people want to be muslim - then fine .
but when it become their life objective to annoy the life out people with their " read the quaran - or die ! !!" thread , it become a bit annoy -@ _ @-
over the past -CONST--0 @-@ -CONST--1 year i 've have quite a few discussion with people about current affair ( namely the issue of terrorism and the related issue of immigration , global politics etc ) and quite often hear a common belief that a british civil war will erupt when ethnic minority increase in number and become more estabished .
this beleif be common amonst certain white british nationalist etc...
i do n't believe this will ever happen for various reasons....
do any of you beleive that a british @/@ english civil war will take place ( on the basis of race/identity )?
if so , ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you predict/envisage ?
i believe it will happen ( something similar to what NE_country-0 have now to an NE_country-1 @-@ NE_country-2 type thing ) .
what a ridiculous comparison .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be it any different ?
the only difference be NE_country-0 be still suffer injustice .
as the number of minority group who do n't respect secular law increase they will demand greater autonomy , and mini @-@ vassal state will appear but still remain part of the NE_country-0 ( like NE_country-1 ) and thing will get pretty tense .
so you reckon that ENT_ordinal-entity-0 a large imperial power will rule the NE_country-0 ( like the NE_empire-0 rule NE_country-1 ) .
this imperial power will be defeat and then power will pass to another power ( like NE_country-0 become a NE_country-1 mandate ) .
so you think that an entire group of people be go to move to the NE_country-0 after a genocide , and then a state will be establish , vote for and partition by the NE_organization-0 ?
you then think that neighbouring country will then invade this new state , that the native NE_country-0 people will be force to flee to like NE_province-0 ( NE_world-region-0 ) and NE_province-1 , NE_province-2 , NE_province-3 , NE_province-4 , NE_province-5 and a part of NE_city-0 ( NE_country-region-0 ) .
that these british people will form militant group , that want to return to the former NE_country-0 .
that this new state will be support by the NE_country-0 who will provide -CONST--0 with diplomatic protection and weaponry ?
as i say , absolutely mental to transplant NE_country-0 @/@ NE_country-1 to the NE_country-2 .
not sure how NE_country-0 can call itself a civilised country when a woman be rape every -CONST--0 minute .
for some people , civilisation seem to rest on how rapist be treat ENT_amr-unknown-0 in custody and not how ENT_amr-unknown-1 rapist actually exist .
i be disgust by NE_country-0 .
something need to be do obviously the easiest way to stop rape be to deal with rapist a lot tough and send out a clear message that it be not acceptable .
at the moment they be give on average -CONST--0 year in jail .
its a disgrace .
no other country in the history of the world have be so permissive towards criminal .
britain : weak on crime , tough on the victim of crime .
on a serious note rapist should have longer sentence , i would be happy for them to spend their whole life in prison if it 's beyond practically any doubt they rape someone
i do n't see how tougher prison sentence will prevent rape from occur .
the appellation of ' rapist ' be stigmatising enough ; the scum who rape people clearly do n't care about the consequence .
the sentence rapist and paedophiles ae give be joke .
wow , people be so reactionary .
there be so many different type of rape , and situation , a single life sentance make no sense .
it be a crime of massive degree of difference , i think the mark of a good legal system be that it can deal with every individual crime , rather than simply hand out the same punishment ragrdless of the circumstance .
that say , we could be tougher on all criminal , not just rapist .
and , to put thing into perspective , ENT_amr-unknown-0 often do women have consensual sex ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 's that ?
you do n't know(!)
oh well nvm then...
bring back capital punishment .
sorry to have to point out the bleed obvious to the majority of you , but it seem like a minority of user actually have to be tell this : do not make troll post or " joke " about rape , it be n't funny .
for rape ?
are you for real ?
not just rapist , overall perhaps ?
i 'm honestly shock by that number , i would have think it would be more than that .
although that be just the number of report rape , which probably do n't even account for half .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you mean by that ?
do you think it 's not one of the most serious crime ?
i keep frequently see thread make hate on NE_religious-group-0 , which be somewhat hypocritical and disturbing i believe in many case .
i be an atheist ; therefore i be not try to defend NE_religious-group-0 out of be ' islamic ' before i be accuse of that .
i be also consider by british nationalist to be -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 british ( although i reject the idea that NE_country-0 make a real difference ) , so i be not show sympathy for NE_religious-group-0 out of experience similar hostility or racism .
however , i do believe that NE_religious-group-0 and NE_religious-group-1 , along with other major religion , all play very similar and negative role in the world .
therefore , i do not believe we should be cherry @-@ pick NE_religious-group-0 as some specific evil , but rather oppose all religion for the extremely negative role they play in the world .
the usual argument held against NE_religious-group-0 be that it be responsible for terrorism .
this may be correct , but the fact of the matter be ; whether somebody be use NE_religious-group-0 to commit terrible act , regardless of the wrongdoing , all major religion play a large role in shape society , and ultimately , fulfil play a very similar negative role .
and when use the idea that NE_religious-group-0 ‘inspires terrorism’, if we be honestly that bother about such wrong @-@ do in the world , then we would surely be more concern with end the much more severe crisis 's and wrong @-@ do 's such as starvation and war .
both of these ill be far more widespread and important than the threat of terrorism , as of which we be more like to die by our own hand rather than by the hand of an ' NE_religious-group-0 terrorist '.
it be almost unbelievable how the idea that a NE_religious-group-0 should have any sympathy or support when they proclaim a dislike for NE_religious-group-1 , when the religion they subscribe to right now in britain , be play a much more negative role .
we should oppose religion simply on the basis that all religion play a negative role .
but we should not bully specific religion because of certain condition and influence of the society we presently live in .
this be of course , an argument only for those who aspire to reason , rationality and evidence in mind .
i have no expectation that i will be receive any support for my remark by NE_religious-group-0 or other adherent of major religion .
i be an atheist and i think NE_religious-group-0 be the most inherently evil religion out of all the other one .
i would choose to live in a NE_religious-group-0 society over a muslim one any day .
as an atheist i can differentiate between NE_religious-group-0 and NE_religious-group-1 be progressive , whilst NE_religious-group-2 be not .
well to be honest it 's a -CONST--0 head coin .
i completely agree sometimes , there be a horrendously bad labeling of NE_religious-group-0 unnecessarily .
but sometimes it do no come under as much criticism ( for small case , not the religion as a whole ) as other religion because people just get label racist .
i know everybody be gonna neg me as racist but someone have to say it .
similarly to how not all claim be create equal , and individual claim require differ level of evidence , neither be all religion create equal and it be rational to dislike a certain religion over another if one can be show to be more detrimental to another .
so it be irrelevant that you believe all religion play a negative role , even though i agree with you , because our priority should be focused on those which be the most detrimental .
would you honestly have us use the same resource in combating the negative effect of NE_religious-group-0 and combating the negative effect of NE_religious-group-1 ?
i would also like you to back up your assertion that NE_religious-group-0 , which in this country be in a weak and almost laughable form , be play a more negative role in britain 's society than NE_religious-group-1 be right now .
also , read your post you appear to be a highly arrogant , self @-@ righteous , and cocky person .
your last sentence be almost cringe worthy in its self @-@ importance .
you 're -CONST--0 .
time to get some humility and eat some humble pie , because i guarantee you 're go to be wrong on countless thing throughout your life .
if you compare a traditionally christian/buddhist/whatever country to a traditionally NE_religious-group-0 country in term of stability , equality , safety and crime , quality of life etc , there 's a good chance the non @-@ NE_religious-group-1 one be go to come out on top ( there would likely be exception , but as a general rule.)
that be -CONST--0 reason why people perceive it to be worse for society .
and i do n't say this out of hate .
i 'm aware that most individual muslims be friendly and civilised fellow .
we live in an age where celebrity be god and fame be seek after above all else .
people go crazy when see celebrity , faint when they touch them and track their each and every movement via magazine , hell there 's a subforum dedicate to them on this site !
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do we feel the need to elevate people to celebrity status and worship them ? i really do n't understand how this culture emerge and ENT_amr-unknown-1 .
must have something to do with provide people with god to worship and adore in an age in which god have be kill . by do so , i guess , many people be save from nihilism as a result of the loss of value from the death of NE_person-0 . thus , superstar and rockstars be put on a pedastal for people to look up to and aspire to be like . if we be live in ancient NE_city-0 , for example , the superstar and rockstars would be the heroic gladiator , but the best gladiator be often think of as god in their own right . they be supposedly treat like god . ceasar himself be worship as a NE_person-1 by the people . the god of yestreday be the star of today . when NE_person-2 become famous they be say he be a NE_person-3 . great individual be sometimes regard as more than human by their fan . NE_person-4 , NE_person-5 , NE_person-6 , NE_person-7 , NE_person-8 , NE_person-9 , NE_person-10 , NE_person-11 , NE_person-12 , NE_person-13 , boy band like NE_band-0 , NE_person-14 and the like .
i think its disgust that the death of a drink and drug adict get -CONST--0 seperate article on the NE_organization-0 website , and there wasnt even a mention of the NE_country-0 soldier kill in the same week . people need to get priority in order
i can n't recall hear of this much before the riot of late , so i wonder whether it will become a regular crime from now on .
it do n't have to occur alongside a riot , but carefully plan and limit to a close circle , it could be a very lucractive crime .
if a circle of -CONST--0 @-@ -CONST--1 target a high @-@ end retailer during a perfectly normal shop day , perhaps at a strategic location and time , i do n't really see what could stop them from loot a shop with lot of valuable merchandise within proximity of the entrance e.g. luxury clothe shop .
if we make that number -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 it would be nearly impossible to stop them .
are you try to set something up or ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
that 's different though , the riot be promote like a chain letter , be n't they , rather than a plot between a few people who all actually knew each other , and therefore could be round up fairly easily .
and surely it 's just " loot " because it be still associate with general civil unrest .
but people will see the footage of them carry off luxury goods for nothing and even pose alongside plasmas .
they 'll get idea .
apparently it be in a multicultural office . my arse it be .
even our own NE_country-0 people arent even allow to do anything because it will offend these immigrants...
as NE_person-0 say , " so ENT_amr-unknown-0 if youre offend ?
im offend by backwards baseball cap and chew gum , doesnt mean im go to abolish it "
okay , i mean to say ban , not arrest .
id like to make this clear , its not the muslims be have a go at , but the official .
they recieved complaint ( could be muslims , we dont know ) , and the official say breastfeed be offfensive to muslims .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do the official ssay that ?
i think its because this country be afraid of muslims - suicide bomber , poppy burner , stone people to death.... you know the story .
these official be say its offensive because they want to go on the muslims good side and not make any enemy .
NE_religious-group-0 be a bad religion .
in fact all religion be bad imo .
i think that 's a bit much .
it 's not up to NE_religious-group-0 if she breastfeed her child her not .
tell her to fee her baby in a toilet be also ridiculous .
NE_religious-group-0 be n't offend by breastfeed , it be just the labour councillor of the multicultural office say ' it will offend them '
people like this just end up create argument between 2 different religion @/@ community for no reason what so ever
you know ENT_amr-unknown-0 the problem be with this country ?
our school dont teach critical think .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 of a **** do you have to be to design a curriculum without critical think on it ?
if you can ban something somebody else do based on your faith , everybody else can ban thing you do based on their faith .
if you want everybody else to use reason with you , you have to use reason with them .
how ENT_amr-unknown-0 of you support capital punishment ?
this be what i think @-
argument for :
- those who murder deserve to have the same done to them
- can be a deterrent
- justice for the victim 's family
- cheap than prison
argument against :
- the person kill could be innocent
- it 's inhumane and barbaric , the criminal may be able to be reform
- it make us just as bad as them
ultimately , i really do n't know ENT_amr-unknown-0 i stand on this issue . up until recently i be very much in favour of it . i 'd say that maybe it should be use in extreme circumstance but it 'd be difficult to know ENT_amr-unknown-1 not to execute someone .
any comment ?
to be honest i 'm for it if it 's cheaper . other than that , meh . -CONST--0 think be in isolation for ENT_temporal-quantity-0 at a ENT_temporal-quantity-1 would be worse than a quick death , although i 'm not sure .
but then , i 'm not sure if the death sentance would be cheaper , as you 'd have to have a mass of appeal and such like before hand .
i would n't support it for ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time offenses , but when a criminal be give a ENT_ordinal-entity-1 chance and reoffends , i 'm all for it... i mean , if the evidence be -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 conclusive that be , which be the case most of the time now with modern technology etc
i be on a tour in NE_country-0 last week when the operator on the bus ask ENT_amr-unknown-0 everyone be from .
as it happen i be the only NE_country-0 person on the bus , and when ask i say that i be from ' NE_country-1 '.
the guide then say , ' no you 're not , you 're from the NE_country-0 ' and start make a big deal out of it and i get quite embarassed .
i be actually really angry at that though because i identify far more as NE_country-0 than i do as NE_country-1 .
when we be in the pub later on , -CONST--0 NE_country-0 also comment , say that they do n't think it be right for him to say that , as you would n't expect a NE_country-1 person to say that they be from the NE_country-2 .
be it only the NE_country-0 who be n't allow this kind of pride in where they live ?
personally i find it nonsensical to be proud of something you have n't choose or done , but it 's up to you if you want to be proud where you come from .
i could n't care less really ENT_amr-unknown-0 my nationality be , it 's just letter on a passport ,
i still wonder ENT_amr-unknown-0 my identity be , a human be , a brit , a NE_continent-0 ?
no , i prefer to call myself a overgrown monkey .
you be allow to state where you 're from .
that be n't pride . that 's just a statement of fact .
i do n't think there 's anything massively wrong to to feel a sentimental pride towards your country ,
it be human nature to feel attach to where you come from .
it be nationalism that become an issue .
his jump down your throat be his problem .
you 're from the NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 so in my opinion which ever one you choose to identify yourself as you be correct .
you 've probably guess ENT_amr-unknown-0 this one 's about !
in the -CONST--0 census , the question of what people 's religious affiliation be , and many people decide to put " NE_religious-group-0 " in the hope that it would be recognised as an official religion .
it be n't . but -CONST--0 people decide tocall themselves jedis anyway .
i 'm wonder ENT_amr-unknown-0 people make of this .
i kinda expect more jedis to be out there , although in all honesty , i would say that i have n't actually see anyone wield a lightsaber , so that may be flaw .
i just think that -CONST--0 in every -CONST--1 people be a bit small , since the campaign be well @-@ publicised , and there be no repurcussions for not tell the truth on the religion question .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 do everyone else make of it ?
i know quite a few NE_religious-group-0 put down ''jedi'' on the census as they do n't want ENT_government-organization-0 record that they be NE_religious-group-1 - that 's how NE_person-0 manage to find all the NE_religious-group-2 so easily - it be all keep carefully on detailed and accurate note .
it can be argue that it be none of the ENT_government-organization-0 's concern as to ENT_amr-unknown-0 each jew/muslim/sikh/christian etc. lives..
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would that affect gdp or the state of the economy ?
on the other hand it can be say that they should know who practice what as they run the country and can thus make law accord the proportionate number of each faith etc.
- as a NE_ethnic-group-0 and have experience anti @-@ semtism myself ( as many jews have and do ) i would sway towards the former view in term of safety , but i can understand ENT_amr-unknown-0 people would disagree with this and choose the latter .
earlier this month the result from the -CONST--0 NE_country-0 social attitude survey be publish by the ENT_government-organization-0 .
the main find , as mention in the title , be that for the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 a full -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of NE_country-0 people no long associate themselves with any religion , and over half of the people that do affiliate with a religion never attend religious service or meeting , with only -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 attend such event on -CONST--2 weekly basis .
it 's die . good .
i do n't really care either way , to be honest .
all this really prove be that the question on the census need reword .
nice to see that those lack a religion be now a majority , although thankfully NE_country-0 NE_religious-group-0 tend to be very reserve and moderate unlike their NE_country-1 counterpart .
though undoubtedly many of the response on this thread will still use the -CONST--0 census as a reliable source for religious demographics despite the fact it 's -CONST--1 year old .
good .
will be interesting to compare this to the census data when it 's release .
i be regain my faith in humanity .
NE_country-0 next .
NE_country-0 be probably a lost cause , but i 'm please to see we 're go NE_world-region-0 .
this be n't intrinsically an anti @-@ NE_religious-group-0 thread .
nor be i say that other religion do n't have follower that do thing that be similar and worse .
today that 's not my focus .
-CONST--0 of lamb be ritually kill a short time ago .
many muslims make the claim that it be do in a way that be painless .
however , i 'm unsure of what be really go on .
children be see to be show disrespect and a lack of care .
adult the same .
even if you claim that animal and human simply be n't equal , it do not justify harm them .
it would be like claim i be above someone else therefore i can do what i want to them .
it do n't make any sense .
this video show the lamb , which appear to be in a great deal of pain , be kill .
my question be , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be that peaceful ?
or justify ?
in this day and age in the NE_world-region-0 it have become increasingly easy to be a vegan .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 would you put animal intentionally through unnecessary pain and suffer ?
graphic video in spoiler :
-CONST--0 minute in you see a lamb kill .
6.44 what look like salt be put over where the wound will be . will this not worsen the pain ?
during the NE_event-0 , muslims remember and commemorate the trial and triumph of the prophet NE_person-0 ( as ) .
the meat from the sacrifice of NE_event-0 be mostly give away to others although there be no limit to what may be eat or give in charity or use to fee the poor or the rich or even if one want to give it away cook or uncooked .
generally though , it be prefer that you give most of it in charity .
the method of slaughter be similar to the one used throughout the whole world , by muslims and non @-@ muslims .
there be probably many variant though but consider -CONST--0 method " worse " than another be subjective .
the most important difference though be that in NE_religious-group-0 , you be obligate to put the animal under as little pain as possible and to treat it humanely ( during the slaughter and every instant of it 's live before it ) .
anyone who say halal ritual do not cause pain be a liar .
i have see an animal throat slit and it survive and be in a lot of pain .
ironically it be a pig that be be slaughter .
i be in NE_country-0 and they slit its throat .
before any muslim say " it be n't do properly , " do n't talk that crap .
the cut be so deep i be surprise it be n't fully decapitate .
however the pig squeal in agony and be still run until it bleed out .
i 'm sorry but its all a load of crap " halal doesnt cause pain "
if you have a problem with the slaughter of animal , you should be vegetarian and disapprove of all slaughter , which i assume you be .
why this have anything to do with NE_religious-group-0 and a festival where lamb be slaughter for the poor in memory of NE_person-0 's ) loyalty to NE_person-1 i do not see .
oh and btw , a few year ago -CONST--0 be in a town near my home city in NE_country-0 with my family for NE_event-0 - and literally the people there be starve and malnourished beyond belief .
to such people , the pain of an animal be the last thing on their mind .
i only mention because it be so easy to view thing from a western ENT_ordinal-entity-0 world perspective , which be why we also criticise NE_country-0 fur farm where fur be strip from animal when they be alive cause unbelievable pain for incredibly long extended period , but to a NE_country-1 family in the remote rural region , NE_country-2 be their only source of bread and butter - and trust me , these people who really do not know whether they will get another meal ( unlike the gluttony we engage in -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 since birth here in the NE_world-region-0 ) think very differently from us - and justifiably so .
the recent case of the NE_religious-group-0 pastor in NE_country-0 have give me cause to ponder the question in the thread title .
here we have a man who know that his life be in great peril if he refuse to recant his NE_religious-group-0 faith , yet that be exactly what he do .
it go without say that his bravery be truly commendable .
his possible martyrdom parallel that of the apostle who evangelised in the knowledge that what they be do would likely get them kill .
i often wonder if i would be so brave if i be in their shoe
i love god more than anything , but it 's impossible to imagine ENT_amr-unknown-0 kind of pressure the pastor in NE_country-0 be under .
would you sacrifice yourself in defence of your faith ?
yes , without doubt , yes i will sacrifice myself in defence of my faith .
god do sacrifice himself for us , so i think it 's sensible for us to sacrifice ourselves for our religion .
even if i be religious i doubt i would ever die for my religion .
whats the point ?
do you think it get you an automatic ticket to heaven ?
be it go to change the mind of the one who kill you ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 about your family and friend ?
if someone hold a gun to your head and demmands you recant , just f***ing do it ! !
it doesnt mean anything , god isnt go to deny you access to heaven because you make a perfectly rational decision under intense pressure
i 've be watch some of his video and i definitely think he have a right to criticize religion if he want to .
but i find a lot of the time he make such sweeping statement and sometimes unnecessary insult that annoy me .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think of him and his video ?
he 's a bit aggressive , rave and rant a lot , and mix up a lot of different political stance into -CONST--0 bundle when many be in no way relate , but beyond that....
yeah , guy speak a lot of truth .
everytime when i watch him , i think to myself " okay , we get it .
you hate muslims .
and your point is..?".
just spot the thread about the NE_work-of-art-0 , and look over at it they 're seem to be some people claim to not only believe in bigfoot but claim to have see one , not im not sure if this be sarcasm , -CONST--0 ENT_amr-unknown-0 the hell....
anyone see a real life sasquatch ?
i 've see an actual photograph of an -CONST--0 person in an actual bigfoot costume .
do that count ?
for any who be n't already aware NE_person-0 believe he come upon a sasquatch trackway and i while camp with friend on NE_island-0 several year ago find -CONST--0 set of track and have a close range audio encounter with what at the time -CONST--1 attributed to sasquatch( es @- at the ENT_temporal-quantity-0 -CONST--2 think there be an adult and juvenile ) but now -CONST--3 discount the event as inconclusive and likely mistaken identity give the spurious nature of bf evidence .
however , i still fel pretty confident i could rule out hoax because of the remoteness of the area .
but hey , you never know...
i actually surf in after -CONST--0 year because -CONST--1 want to hear the NE_organization-0 side on this issue . no one appear to have post about this yet .
apparently , the -CONST--0 folk that die pay nearly -CONST--1 dollar to attend the new age sweat lead by -CONST--2 time NE_person-0 guest .
NE_person-0 - a non @-@ NE_ethnic-group-0 , lead over -CONST--0 people into the sweat ' lodge '.
-CONST--0 people become ill , and -CONST--1 more be still in critical condition tonight .
i just read about this story .
it 's a tragedy , and i also find it reveal that the new age guru in question , NE_guru-0 , have since leave the NE_state-0 .
from what i understand , it sound like NE_person-0 do n't know what the hell he be do , because he put entirely too many people in entirely too small a space .
in addition , they cover the lodge with material that do n't allow for decent air flow .
put all of that together , and you have a situation ripe for asphyxiation .
apparently they be still want to question the guy .
they say he be uncooperative .
i do n't know much about the law on this but would n't it be negligent homicide or something ?
this would be an interesting story to keep up with .
i have be search for this story to no avail .
a few week ago me and a few friend watch a tv show on NE_publication-0 ( their house not mine ! ) where a guy claim to have recover from a coma with a newfound ability...
he can play the piano like an expert .
he say he can n't write music , but he see musical note in his mind and he can " miraculously " play them seemingly perfect , or close to it .
he claim to have no musical train and have never play an instrument in his life .
my b.s. meter go off , of course .
do anyone here have more information about this guy ?
i can n't remember his name...i think he be in the NE_country-0
i can n't find anything on the web or here at NE_organization-0 .
for musician : i wonder ENT_amr-unknown-0 he would handle key signature since he say the note just fly by in his mind .
are they notate as sharp or flat ?
or be he stick in NE_music-key-0 forever ?
my off the cuff guess be that he play the piano before the coma .
perhaps he be a fail musician and see an opportunity to get into the limelight .
i would think people in -CONST--0 life would know that he could play previously , but as we all know , believer won't care , or simply claim that these people be lie .
the ability to play the piano and other instrument to a high level not only involve technical ability but also physical train ( remember the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time you try to spin note on a guitar or piano ? )
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be it possible he wake with all his piano play muscle fully develop ?
well in the case of the guy NE_person-0 write about , it be more a matter of wake up to a newfound passion for the piano , not that he wake a fully develop piano player .
he claim to have be a guy who listen to rock music before the accident , but afterward could n't get enough of piano music , start to sit down at a piano to play , and then more and more often , and then he be hear music in his head , and it just become an obsession .
so nothing really mystical about it . the man himself seem to put a spiritual spin on it , but it make sense all the same without it .
i 'd say it 's not impossible .
he seem to be play by ear .
his music be unstructured ; it sound like he 's just play whatever come into his head .
he 's not play classical work like NE_person-0 .
also , i 'd say he 's self @-@ teach at the very least .
watch his hand .
he do n't hold them in the typical position that most piano player be teach .
he look like he 's just stab at the next note he want to play .
it have be note that there have be a lot of thread create on the topic of global warm .
a great number of these topic rapidly descend into bicker and other rule violation .
although -CONST--0 of the biggest thread be put on moderate status , it seem that many of the other thread have spring up in order to avoid moderate status .
that thread have now be close .
since many of the thread cover the same or similar ground , we 've decide to keep only this thread for general global warm discussion , which will be moderate .
unless the topic be very different from the " general " discussion , new thread and post about global warm will be move to that thread if they satisfy the membership agreement .
failure to confine general discussion to this moderate thread or start other thread for general discussion will be treat as rule -CONST--0 violation and subject to a series of escalate penalty just like any other membership violation .
we hope this will encourage civility in the discussion of global warm .
we realize this topic inspire strong emotion , but -CONST--0 contain your emotion to those form which be permissible under the NE_law-0 .
i do n't know if you guy have follow NE_person-0 's channel on NE_publication-0 , but his series of delightfully devastate and wither video on climate science and creationism be something to behold .
the latest in the series look at the " scientist " that represent the denialist side in the climate " debate "
-CONST--0 'm aware of -CONST--1 , have read a few article and what not over the last few month .
the response be of course tongue and cheek , a commentary on the nonsense that you can n't have a meaningful discussion without hot link .
hoepfully this new thread will promote just such discussion .
i do n't see how , short of turn to nuclear entirely , how we can reduce NE_small-molecule-0 level without sequester and ge .
not only that , but if you believe the current model to be accurate , we need to reduce the effect of NE_small-molecule-0 now .
so this could have be in the science , music , or current event forum and if any mod should choose to move it , that will be fine with me .
i 'm watch the NE_show-0 and they 've put on a tribute to NE_person-0 include campbell sing NE_music-0 .
and in the tribute they announce he have NE_disease-0 .
it amaze me that people be be diagnose when they still have enough think capacity to discuss their fate .
be rich , i hope he get to try the new treatment recently successfully use on mice .
i would .
it 's a drug currently approve for chemotherapy in human .
this will be remarkable if it pan out .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 do i post this and make it about NE_person-0 instead of just about the science ?
i do n't know .
it just strike me hear the announcement NE_person-0 have NE_disease-0 at the same time he be still well enough to appear on stage at the NE_award-0 .
it 's weird .
and the discovery of a treatment that be a drug already approve for use in human should make a bit different of a pathway for research .
if you be wealthy or simply have access to the drug , and have NE_disease-0 would you use it immediately instead of wait for conclusive study ?
i have this discussion with NE_person-0 ( fls ) in the past and i really wish she have n't leave the forum because i 'd like to use this example to revisit the discussion .
i can n't speak for her but i get the impression she would wait for the research to be more conclusive .
i use the criteria : if it be not harmful and there be some evidence it might work , and if there be no better alternative , i think it be worth try .
in this case it be the potential benefit and lack of any alternative treatment and the fact NE_disease-0 be such a devastate terminal disease that it outweigh the fact the research be premature .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 say the rest of you ?
i 'd do it in a heartbeat .
our brain be who we be , and without memory we be just animal .
you risk almost nothing , to gain everything .
my feel be that when i grow old enough that i 've " have a good run , " ENT_amr-unknown-0 not donate my body to science before i die ?
if -CONST--0 have some disease that will kill me in a few month or year anyway , then , by all mean , experiment on me with some new drug that have potential .
and if i have some issue that won't kill me for awhile , well , ENT_amr-unknown-0 the hell if the new drug cause some side effect ?
i can always stop take it .
either way , there be some chance that i 'll help people younger than i be .
and once i die , then take my body and do whatever be useful with it .
i do n't need it anymore .
i be my mind .
at age -CONST--0 , with the possibility of NE_disease-0 loom in my future , i would take any supplement or drug -- experimental or otherwise -- that may prevent or delay this dread condition .
obviously i would avoid anything demonstrably and seriously harmful .
many conjecture like nsaids , NE_product-0 , fish oil have come and gone .
i have and will continue to try them all until they be proven ineffective or seriously harmful .
precious little news on development .
last i see NE_country-0 scientist be say that they may have reach the surface .
i be frankly about as interested in this as be humanly possible .
though i expect that little will be find outside of micro @-@ organism , i have hope that there will be discovery similar to those around the black smoker .
my kid be hope for NE_thing-0 .
they may have to wait until after NE_festival-0 .
a bit of an anticlimax consider the conversation we have on the subject last year ,
much more grip than this thread mate !
the huge interconnected lake about -CONST--0 mile below antarctic ice can n't be touch because they must be under enormous pressure .
i would think that to drill into them would cause a collapse of -CONST--0 of mile of ice , erupt water , flood and wipe out area the size of NE_state-0 ?
as be usual at NE_organization-0 , much hilarity and education then ensued...
anxiety and inattention over NE_city-0 's next NE_thing-0
it point out that a magnitude -CONST--0 earthquake be actually -CONST--1 time smaller in term of energy release that the magnitude -CONST--2 earthquake that cause the tsunami last year .
however , the NE_earthquake-0 of -CONST--0 which kill over -CONST--1 be a -CONST--2 .
and , i 'm pretty sure they do n't mean that this earthquake will be exactly magnitude -CONST--0 .
it could be bigger .
still , i think that NE_city-0 be more earthquake @-@ resistant today than it be in -CONST--0 .
so , i guess i 'll take my chance .
take your chance ? !
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you live in NE_city-0 ?
curious...do other earthquake agency agree with the data from NE_city-0 ?
i would like to know what scale they 're use , because different seismic scale can result in enormously different result .
a perfect example be the -CONST--0 largest NE_city-0 earthquake .
the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 be m7+ but do only minor damage and cause no fatality due to a low mercalli intensity read ( actual measure of intensity of shake in a particular place ) .
the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 m6.3 quake register at x ( intense ) and higher on the mercalli intensity scale and have the highest peak ground ENT_acceleration-quantity-0 ever record .
many seismologist have say that the quake would have completely flatten almost any city in the world .
in term of energy release , the deadly NE_city-0 quake be not particularly big , but in term of shake intensity it be one of the most destructive quake ever record .
NE_country-0 's " NE_scale-0 be like the NE_thing-0 , but do n't have anywhere near as many division .
the highest category be -CONST--0 which seem to equate with -CONST--1 on the mercalli scale ( it go up to -CONST--2 ) .
this basically mean a scale -CONST--0 quake could be anything from a decently size but not overly destructive quake right up to a city @-@ leveling event .
i hear this term for a single world currency .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be it that cts seem to think this be a threat ?
we can n't even get -CONST--0 political party to agree on fundamental economic principle .
there 's no reason to believe that we could get the NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 to ever agree on a common currency .
plus , the euro zone be show strain around the edge , so now would be a very bad time to try .
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you guy think the NE_country-0 invade NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 ?
do you think our leader really think NE_country-0 have wmd ?
and do you think they actually care ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 benefit from the war ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 industry , ENT_amr-unknown-1 money @/@ power interest , ENT_amr-unknown-2 lobby group , etc ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the NE_country-0 posture so strongly against NE_country-1 ?
are they really concern about wmds ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would NE_country-0 do with wmds that would scare the NE_country-1 so much ?
NE_country-0 take great control and spread rebellion against NE_country-1 ?
regional arm race ?
NE_country-0 use the bomb ?
NE_country-0 have be toying with the idea of " revisiting " NE_country-1 ever since the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 war end , particularly in -CONST--0 , when NE_person-0 ENT_ordinal-entity-1 start get coy with the inspector .
it do n't get much traction then because NE_country-0 be , at the time , experience a resurgance of isolation after the end of the NE_war-0 .
the issue be the same then , but NE_person-0 find the post @-@ NE_incident-0 NE_country-0 a bit more ameniable to the idea of war .
oil , wmds , NE_criminal-organization-0 , these be all simply mcguffins .
the real reason be that NE_person-0 be a petty dictator who weilded an inordinate amount of influence and be continually give the impression that he be up to something .
whether he actually be or not be n't the point .
be careful of special interest group hijack the message .
that 's what happen to the NE_political-party-0 lead them to be co @-@ opted into the NE_broadcast-program-0 NE_political-party-1 .
even if people show up who you agree with on some political issue , ask yourselves if that issue be actually relate to what the protest be about .
there will be , and probably already be , many faction who want nothing more than to turn the entire movement into a NE_political-party-0 fundraiser .
suddenly it will be about collective bargain for teacher or something else that do n't involve a corporation at all , let alone NE_company-0 .
the partisan on both side will try and expand their trench such that your movement fall into them .
keep an eye out , do n't be the next NE_political-party-0 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 identity ?
it 's a collection of every wingnut cause out there , from NE_person-0 paultards to communist to anarchist to anti @-@ NE_country-0 to people who like to dress as zombie .
they want more ENT_government-organization-0 , less ENT_government-organization-1 , more immigration , protectionism , etc etc.
they protest corporation even as they organize on NE_publication-0 and NE_publication-1 and NE_publication-2 use laptop computer and smart phone , all fruit of corporation .
they rail against oil company while power generator with gasoline .
they want to end capitalism , while also get better pay .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 entity will pay them absent capitalism i have no idea .
kid throw a temper tantrum , basically .
they interview some of them on NE_publication-0 the other day .
-CONST--0 guy admit they do n't have a cohesive message and he be n't sure if they could have -CONST--1 consider the disparate group that be there .
he also acknowledge the irony of use large corporation like NE_company-0 to get the message out and use the NE_company-1 to go to the bathroom .
the NE_newspaper-0 print an opinion piece by a mr NE_person-0 which assert NE_country-0 's political system be superior to americas .
i do n't know if they though they be be edgy , but that 's a pretty stupid thing to print .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 next ?
NE_religious-group-0 attitude to women superior to the NE_world-region-0 's ?
you think people should only print that which toe the party line ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be it a " stupid thing to print " - opinion piece as far as i know be mean to be opinion and it may surprise some folk but not everyone hold the same opinion as they do .
given that news paper often print opinion piece to raise interest in their title it seem that it be far from be a pretty stupid thing to print as we be talk about the newspaper...
yeah , your thread title rather give a mislead opinion about the NE_disease-0 .
i 'm sure that be a complete accident of course .
i hear all sort of perspective on marriage . those who think monogamy be the proper standard , those who think monogamy be a tool use to oppress women , those who think that polygamy be terrible , those who think that polygamy be natural , etc.
but virtually ever culture in the world have some form of marriage...a concept in which a life @-@ long union be idealize , where there be formal ceremony to ' sanctify ' a man and a woman ( or multiple thereof ) . culture where , from childhood , children be raise and teach these ideal to the point where most of us think it be a natural part of human nature .
the form of marriage may differ from culture to culture , but it be consistent throughout our culture .
that be , except for at least -CONST--0 very unique NE_culture-0 , a NE_country-0 minority group who live in the NE_mountain-0 , close to the border with NE_province-0 .
-CONST--0 year ago , i establish a non @-@ profit organization to work with the NE_ethnic-group-0 , focusing on a variety of aspect ( education , development , etc.), but also on promote awareness of their culture , and to try to preserve it .
in the NE_ethnic-group-0 culture , there be no marriage .
no marriage ceremony exist .
there be no expectation whatsoever of life @-@ time bond or pairings .
children be raise not only without an expectation of spend their life with that -CONST--0 special person , but they often do n't even know ( or care ) ENT_amr-unknown-0 their biological father be .
in the NE_ethnic-group-0 culture , men and women can change and choose partner as they please .
monogamy be not consider special or even particularly desirable .
the NE_ethnic-group-0 live in large extended family , with many generation ( grandparent , parent , children , grandchildren , etc.) all live together in the same house .
men sleep in communal sleep room ( they do n't have private bedroom ) ; only the women have the luxury of a private bedroom .
thus , women tend to the the one in control of relationship .
traditionally , a NE_ethnic-group-0 woman will invite a man to spend the night with her .
the man will come to her home at night , sneak in through her window ( -CONST--0 be also a part of the NE_ethnic-group-0 culture that , while everyone know this be happen , it should be do in a manner that be not obvious ) , spend the night , and then leave early the next morning before everyone wake up .
thus the term " walk marriage "...because the men must walk to and from -CONST--0 assign rendevous each night .
the NE_ethnic-group-0 walk marriage be generally the most interesting -- and misunderstood -- aspect of -CONST--0 culture .
people be always fascinate by it , but misunderstanding and misperceptions abound .
-CONST--0 of the most common misperceptions be that the NE_ethnic-group-0 be very promiscuous , change partner all the time .
that be patently not true ; in fact , many NE_ethnic-group-0 pair will last for ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , and even ENT_temporal-quantity-1 .
there be no social stigma if someone do change partner often , but it be more common for the NE_ethnic-group-0 to engage in what have be describe as " serial monogamy "...that be , they do n't stick with -CONST--0 partner for their whole life , but each pair will tend to last for an extended period , and they won't generally have multiple partner while in a relationship .
however , there be fascinate and very unique aspect of these walk marriage .
ENT_ordinal-entity-0 , even among couple who be together for months/years/decades , they generally will never actually live together , or share property .
the man will continue to live in his family 's home , and his responsibility be to that family ; while the woman will continue to live her her home , and be responsible to her family .
the man will visit her at night , but the rest of the time they generally live separate life .
and what if they have a baby ? in general , father have little or no responsibility for children produce from such union ;
the baby will be raise in the mother 's home , and be a part of her family , not the father 's .
however , that do not mean that the men have no responsibility...it be just that the focus of that responsibility be shift .
in most culture , a man will be responsible to care for his own children ;
in NE_ethnic-group-0 culture , a man be responsible to care for the children of his sisters/nieces/aunts/etc . so NE_ethnic-group-1 men still have full parenting responsibilities...perhaps even moreso , since they may end up share responsibility for the children of many family member .
now , in some case , NE_ethnic-group-0 men do want to be involve in their own childrens ' upbringing .
if that be the case , after the child be born , the father will go to the mother 's home , and present the family matriarch with gift , ask to be accept as the father .
if the matriarch accept him , he be then an ' honorary member ' of the family , and have the right to visit and @/@ or stay there like any other family member , and to help raise the child .
however , this be not a frequent practice .
although this sound very strange at first , it actually provide remarkable stability for the children .
ENT_ordinal-entity-0 , they be not raise by just -CONST--0 parent ; everyone in the family share in parental duty , so the child really end up have multiple father and mother figure .
furthermore , if the mother and father end their relationship , there be virtually no impact or stress for the child .
there 's no fight over split property , because they never share property .
there 's no fight over custody of the child , because the child never belong to the father to begin with .
the mother 's relationship with different men may change , but it have little or no effect on the children .
-CONST--0 more thing i 'd like to point out . while this system actually work very effectively for the NE_ethnic-group-0 , it work only in a situation where there be a large extend family to provide support .
for those NE_ethnic-group-0 men and women who leave home to live @/@ work on their own in other city , they almost always choose more traditional marriage .
after all , care for a baby without its father when you have -CONST--0 other people in your home to help you be -CONST--1 thing ;
care for a baby without its father when you live by yourself be another matter entirely .
for more information about the NE_ethnic-group-0 culture , and our work with them , you can check out our organization 's website . and i welcome question and comment about this , or other aspect of NE_ethnic-group-1 culture .
while their way of life hold no particular allure to me ( my job consists of sit , write on paper and think about thing , i be allergic to horse , my great joy be my NE_world-region-0 traditional family of my wife and -CONST--0 daughter ) i applaud your effort to provide as unobtrusive assistance to these people as possible .
diversity of culture and think be a good thing , and i like your organization emphasis on put them in control .
i would suggest that you do n't worry about people who suggest that you try to protect them somehow from the outside world .
if the NE_ethnic-group-0 do n't want you or your organization 's help , i be sure they be quite capable of tell you to get lose .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 you say " we " be do this , ENT_amr-unknown-1 be " we "?
in particular , have you hook up with the various group like the NE_organization-0 and the NE_organization-1 ?
there 's a lot -- well , by linguistics standard , a lot -- of money float around for do exactly this , and it sound like NE_language-0 be -CONST--0 language that might be saveable if you can bring it to the attention of the appropriate professional .
so depending upon who the linguist you be bring in are , it may be possible @/@ practical to get some real heavyweight to come in for their support....
NE_person-0 , sound like you 're do some amaze work !
the NE_ethnic-group-0 sound like a fascinate people .
matrilineal system be indeed rather rare .
i think there use to be ( ) some in NE_world-region-0 .
i do n't know if property be own by female but it be transfer through the female line ( a man 's heir would be his sister 's children ) .
i think some of the NE_ethnic-group-0 tribe in the NE_country-0 plain be also matrilineal .
very interesting . what this show , i think , be that while there be no marriage , there be also no illegitimacy -- that be , most children ( a ) know who their father be ( and the father do not deny it , even if they have no role in care for them ) and ( b ) have -CONST--0 male and female adult ( mother and her brother ) take care of them .
also , it 's easy to see why this social arrangement will discourage promiscuity .
in general , most men will be responsible for raise , roughly , the same number of children as they have , even if they do n't raise their own children .
however , if you be a man who have too many partner -- or , more important , too many children -- you be probably see as a freeloader : someone who make society take care of their many children while only care for a few of society 's children in return .
am i correct here ?
you 're the expert , i 'm just make an educated(?) guess .
you have to wonder ENT_amr-unknown-0 this be not big news and her hearing kinda fade out of the spotlight...
could it be that there be this long drawn out leak that be go to end the world in the NE_country-region-0 , that this ENT_government-organization-0 seem hell bent on let continue ? lol
i be sure their genitalia will make a lot of difference when ti come time to make a decision...
i do n't remember much balleyhoo when the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 black be elevate to the bench but then......
i 've enable multiple choice for this poll because i 'd like you to select which -CONST--0 candidate will finish in the top -CONST--1 in NE_state-0 .
the NE_state-0 primary be just -CONST--0 day away .
in the average of the last -CONST--0 poll there it look like this :
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0
in -CONST--0 of the more recent poll , between -CONST--1 @-@ -CONST--2 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of NE_state-0 voter say they be either " likely to change their mind " or " undecided/uncommitted ".
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be your vote prediction for next tuesday ?
i 'm gonna ramble a bit and then reveal mine .
the consensus appear to be that NE_person-0 need a big win in NE_state-0 in order to propel him in NE_state-1 since his NE_state-2 result be almost to the vote the same total as -CONST--0 .
no new support for NE_person-0 .
in ' 08 , NE_person-0 finish ENT_ordinal-entity-0 to NE_person-1 in NE_state-0 and get -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the vote .
how ENT_amr-unknown-0 of that -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 right now be hardcore NE_person-0 support ?
inexplicably , he avoid an onslaught of attack over the last few week as the focus turn on NE_person-0 , but now -CONST--0 of the big question become about what NE_political-party-0 really think about the idea of NE_person-1 clean up in NE_state-0 and quite possibly everywhere else , too .
i think NE_state-0 be a test of ENT_amr-unknown-0 comfortable or not NE_political-party-0 be with NE_person-0 as the presumptive front @-@ runner .
i think that like NE_state-0 , he 'll hold on to the support in NE_state-1 he get last time .
so he 'll come down to earth a little bit but won't totally implode there .
everybody need to see the NE_state-0 speech .
NE_person-0 's be fiery and disgruntle .
he 's so much more interesting when he 's an attack dog and he be position himself now as want to be the fullback to NE_person-0 ; if he 's go down , he want to take romney with him , and in the meantime that 'll let NE_person-1 have a positive week and float above the fray .
NE_person-0 be leave NE_religious-group-0 country and go into a -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 catholic state .
between hard right establishment catholics there and that close to -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 undecided number , NE_person-0 should be able to get into double digit .
but ENT_amr-unknown-0 high do he go ?
i think if NE_person-0 come down to the low -CONST--0 's and it appear that NE_person-1 keep come up and can crack -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-0 again , it 'll be another soft @-@ boil NE_person-2 non @-@ win win .
if NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 now represent the more traditional NE_political-party-0 establishment and be fight over that share in NE_state-0 , NE_person-2 and NE_person-3 be share the NE_political-party-1 vote .
will NE_person-0 be NE_state-0 's NE_person-1 ?
NE_person-0 appear ready to keep cruise around -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 and another top -CONST--1 finish .
NE_person-0 be totally insignificant and should have quit along with NE_person-1 .
NE_person-0 's ahead by an average of -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 .
that 's go to come down to earth , but ENT_amr-unknown-0 , and ENT_amr-unknown-1 much before it 's perceive that he 's fall and somebody else be rise ?
i think the threshold be that he need to win by -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 in order to gain any kind of traction as the front @-@ runner .
in NE_state-0 , my prediction ( actual result in parenthesis ) be pretty close :
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ( -CONST--1 )
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ( -CONST--1 )
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ( -CONST--1 )
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ( -CONST--1 )
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ( -CONST--1 )
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ( -CONST--1 )
that be with a day or so out .
this be more of a crapshoot at this point but here go .
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0
NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0
i 'm think it 's go to be NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 with a considerable lead , and NE_person-2 ENT_ordinal-entity-0 .
i would be distinctly and pleasantly surprise if NE_person-0 make the top -CONST--0 and absolutely tickle pink if he win , but -CONST--1 do n't see it happen .
NE_person-0 's go to have to get some notice at the debate to finish in the top -CONST--0 .
if the others be attack themselves like children , than maybe he can come up the middle and seem like the adult in the room and then nh will make a statement by elevate him to the anti @-@ NE_person-0 surge candidate in that NE_state-0 .
i feel like it 's go to be tough for him to break out .
you be probably right , NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 for sure , but once the light shine on NE_person-2 , the NE_state-0 voter be n't go to like what they see .
i still see -CONST--0 vote block , NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 and NE_person-2 .
NE_person-0 have n't have a turn be NE_person-1 yet , and he 's more appeal to NE_state-0 voter than NE_person-2 .
NE_person-0 by a big number , because he life in NE_state-0 in a palatial home on NE_lake-0 , and he 's be work on this primary for -CONST--0 year .
NE_person-0 because he 'll draw a lot of independent voter , and i think NE_person-1 be fade along with NE_person-2 .
this be all go down to ENT_amr-unknown-0 the anti @-@ NE_person-0 vote start to close the divide .
in the NE_university-0 poll for wednesday , it be NE_person-0 -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 and NE_person-1 -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 .
today it 's a -CONST--0 @-@ day total now of -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-0 to -CONST--2 ENT_percentage-entity-1 .
from a -CONST--0 point gap to a -CONST--1 point gap . now , if it 's -CONST--2 point after -CONST--3 day , but the -CONST--4 @-@ day total be -CONST--5 , that mean the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 @-@ day stand alone would be -CONST--6 to -CONST--7 , a -CONST--8 point gap .
meanwhile , NE_person-0 be down in the -CONST--0 @-@ day total back to single digit .
NE_person-0 's small bump so far have cost NE_person-1 the most .
watch for him to hit the double digit in the next couple poll .
NE_person-0 be sail with his strong -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 .
i think the video below from a NE_person-0 movie be one of the best piece that could be superimpose and run as a NE_person-1 ad .
i would love to see something like this run on national television .
it 's a preach to the choir ad .
it have no place on television because it do n't speak to the undecideds .
near the end you could replace the " NE_person-0 " chant with any other candidate and it would have the same effect .
there 's nothing in it that speak of NE_person-0 's view or intend policy .
lastly , negative ad be far more effective than positive one .
1940. and still be relevent today .
the ideal NE_person-0 espouse here , will never die , and only get push back , to arise again .
humanity can indeed be thankful for that , that we only go through stage of insanity , and have the chance of overcome that .
this should be an ad for NE_person-0 .
but he would have to cut his tie to the greedy .
his tie to the one behind the curtain , call the shot .
yet this thread be about NE_person-0 , so never mind .
i keep hear ton of people run off at the mouth about how dangerous NE_person-0 's foreign policy be and how they be out of touch with the real world .
the problem be that all the people who would be consider expert , and even NE_country-0 itself ( in regard to NE_country-1 ) , agree with NE_person-0 .
i 've be on -CONST--0 deployment and my job be an NE_language-0 linguist of -CONST--1 year .
i 'm fairly knowledgeable about how the culture work in that part of the world , as be many of the expert .
our interference do , indeed , cause more problem for us than what we be try to stop .
we support the rebel in NE_country-0 and it 's now be take over by radical .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 know ENT_amr-unknown-1 NE_country-0 be go to end up .
anyways , be all the expert kooky as well ?
i find that the judge be actually one of a few mainstream NE_political-party-0 that have a shred of honesty and actually understand what conservatism be .
if someone have only bomb the reactor in NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 , while the NE_country-2 and other country have prosecute and imprison all the traitor who leak nuclear weapon information and give the necessary technology to them...
the NE_country-0 be largely directly to blame for the proliferation of nuclear weapon through its " NE_program-0 .
but back on topic , if NE_person-0 be " kooky " then so be most other politician in any country on the planet .
and that be certainly true with most of our suppose ally .
NE_incident-0 be blowback from us stick our nose in business that be not our business .
with that say , i still want to kill anyone who be responsible in the plan , or anyone who shield these people .
no one in the right mind would think the attacker just do it for shit and giggle .
they think they have valid reason to attack us . and perhaps they do .
NE_country-0 be not perfect .
they be hope to wind us gravely by attack -CONST--0 financial system . a weak link in our chain .
they should have just save those life , because we allow bank to fuck our system up greater than NE_criminal-organization-0 could have ever do .
leave it up to us , to be our worst enemy .
i think that a lot of people automatically assume that anyone who say our foreign policy be why they be angry at us be also justify their response .
it be understandable they be upset , but neither NE_person-0 nor anyone else who be support him be say their response be in any way justify .
indiscriminately targeting women and children be cowardly and people who do that should be capture or kill .
i really be tire of hear that they hate us because -CONST--0 be free or because of -CONST--1 belief .
it would be like you build a shack in my backyard and every now and then one of my dog go miss , then when i get upset that it be there you say i be mad because you have NE_event-0 in your own house back on your property and i hate bacon ( which be clearly only a hypothetical as i love bacon ) .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 ? because expert do n't agree with him on his kooky policy stand , ENT_amr-unknown-1 be manifold :
*denounces the NE_law-0 infringe the free @-@ market right of a monolithic white establishment to immiserate black ;
*dabbles in gold buggery and advocate the elimination of the NE_government-organization-0 , apparently because the global economy work so well back in the era before central bank ( that 's call sarcasm ) ;
*suggests that the border fence be be build to keep NE_country-0 from leave the NE_country-1 ;
*claims that NE_program-0 and NE_program-1 be unconstitutional and should be dismantle ;
*mounts repeat warning that hyperinflation be right around the corner ( NE_person-0 , take a bow ) ;
*insists that global warm be a gigantic hoax ( yes , NE_person-0 know more about global climate science than NE_government-organization-0 ;
*hinted that maybe the NE_government-organization-0 help to coordinate the -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 attack ;
*opposes ENT_government-organization-0 @-@ sponsor flu shot ;
*and allege that the NE_organization-0 want to confiscate our gun .
( list adapt from th be blog )
and this list do n't even get into all the racism and homophobia of his newsletter , which use his name , be sign by him and which raise -CONST--0 of dollar which he be happy to pocket but have be disavow by him now that they be a liability .
note that none of this list mention our relation with NE_country-0 .
there 's lot of kookiness without have to go there .
are you a communist ?
my friend and i walk into a pizza shop .
it be $ -CONST--0 a slice .
they have a special , a -CONST--0 @-@ slice for $ -CONST--1 .
if we both get -CONST--0 slice each , that would make it -CONST--1 slice at a total of $ -CONST--2 .
we be assure the slice in the -CONST--0 @-@ slice be the same size , so we get that .
we each pitch in $ -CONST--0 each ( which can n't even buy you -CONST--1 slice oddly enough ) and get -CONST--2 slice each , which we 've just polish off in fairly record time .
we pool our resource and struck the better deal for the both of us , and we actually make a joke about proud and full communist .
now we 're roll a joint from a bag of wee we each pitch in on in order to save money as well .
got our usual amount of wee each , but each pay $ -CONST--0 less because one of us do the transaction and buy -CONST--1 as much as usual for the individual .
if these thing make me a communist , than i 'll drink to that , but i just call it better business sense mostly .
real communism would be they could go get a pizza without pay at all , and the pizza guy could come by their auto @-@ part place to pick up a distributor cap without pay at all .
real communism only exist in NE_country-0 's kibbutz though .
the problem you be have NE_person-0 be that it be impossible for many people , and especially people in NE_country-0 , to conceive of cooperation and sacrifice without force behind it .
they be so lock into their little me @-@ centric universe that they can n't see cooperate with someone else unless someone make them .
seriously , i think the problem here be that a lot of people in the NE_country-0 , conservative especially , when they hear the word " communism " think of the NE_country-1 .
not only be the NE_country-0 not communist , it do n't even pretend to be .
the word refers in NE_philosophy-0 theory only to the end stage of social progress , what a socialist state and economy evolve into : a stateless utopia in which everything be share equally .
when communism be reach , -CONST--0 be no more , because socialism presume the existence of the state , and under communism there be no state .
the motto under socialism be " from each accord to his ability , to each accord to his work." under communism , it 's the more @-@ familiar , " from each accord to his ability , to each accord to his need ."
the NE_country-0 be socialist .
it never pretend to be communist , even though it be govern by something call the NE_political-party-0 .
communism be what they be in theory evolve towards , but certainly not what they already have .
communism be not a coercive system ; it 's the exact opposite .
neither the private coercion of capitalism , nor the state coercion of socialism be find in a communist society .
if it be possible to have a communist society , it would be a wonderful thing .
edit : i answer " no " to the poll , because although communism be a beautiful dream , i consider it no more than that .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you guy think about a NE_person-0 run for president in -CONST--0 .
though he 's kind of old , he be still sharp and incredibly intelligent - and consistent .
his vote record be very consistent and he do n't vote for any legislation that be n't expressly allow by the constitution .
given this , the grassroots support he have in -CONST--0 , and the fact that his message be very closely align with that of the NE_political-party-0 movement , do think he could head either a NE_political-party-1 ( or more likely ) NE_political-party-2 ticket .
i really think give NE_person-0 's astoundingly consistent message and vote record ( and reputation ) that he could mount a serious challenge to NE_person-1 . w
hat do you guy think ?
the role of leader of the free world be not well fill by an isolationist .
paul/palin , have a nice ring to it .
once again the NE_political-party-0 solution be a geriatric nut , only this time it 's a relgious fanatic instead of senile warmonger .
i wonder , will NE_person-0 be too old in 2016?
NE_person-0 won't be " too old " in -CONST--0 , but she will still be too NE_person-1 .
habemus NE_person-0 !
finally after day of intense political infight in NE_city-0 the new prime minister seem to be the biggest favourite for the job : NE_person-0 .
he be an ex @-@ NE_organization-0 vice president .
but foremost he be not a career politician as his profession be actually an academic -CONST--0 , partly in the NE_country-0 where he also study .
NE_person-0 seem to be well respect in the NE_organization-0 but also within NE_country-0 , as far as a greek prime minister could be respect in a country like NE_country-1 .
i be positively surprise about this choice .
at least someone take over who have an understand of economics in quite some detail and be not from the old political class .
i do n't think one could have hope for anything better than that .
on another note . there be rumors that NE_person-0 could become the next prime minister of NE_country-0 .
NE_person-0 , also dub " NE_alias-0 ", be a former NE_organization-0 commissioner and will still ring some bell NE_city-0 , simply because it be him who do not shy away from take a fight with an extreme heavyweight like NE_company-0 over anti @-@ trust issue .
( same go for company like NE_company-0 etc ) .
if both news would be true , this would make the dark horizon look a little less dark indeed .
these -CONST--0 men would be the best choice for their respective country in time like these in my humble opinion .
they know economics , have a reputation of be not involve in corruption , dare to do what they believe have to be do and be convince NE_continent-0 .
the ex head of the NE_organization-0 take over at the helm of the world 's most financially trouble country and you be " positively " surpised ?
personally i be hope for NE_person-0 , but obviously for different reason .
he be n't the head of the NE_organization-0 but one of the vice president , ie in the govern council of the NE_organization-1 . for all the shortcoming of the euro , i can n't see how the NE_organization-2 have do a bad job .
he seem to be a really clever guy , understand economics like few prime minister in the world probably , as he teach it in NE_university-0 i think .
NE_person-0 would have be a great choice .
well at least it would have make the newspaper look more interesting...
well , she 's not the most attractive woman in the world but for a politician there be n't many hot out there...
she must get lose in my post , what with the other women and all .
i think i have a thing for blonde women...
anyhow , so see as i can find myself talk positively about a socialist like this , be n't it your turn to talk about NE_person-0 like this in thread about the NE_political-party-0 ?
btw , i think give her experience in journalism and tv media , she would have do a good job relay the message of what the essential need of bailout measure be , to the NE_country-0 people .
she also be very respectful in her final day of dissent in the previous coallition , and do n't even call for him to resign .
that i can respect .
it 's a very good idea to have a former NE_organization-0 man in the job .
we have too many bureaucrat and lawyer and career politician in charge of economic matter .
it be good to see someone with economic experience .
i think i 'm one of those who like watch the NE_event-0 for all the new ad .
NE_person-0 be alright and NE_person-1 be pretty funny , but NE_person-2 's ad for NE_company-0 make them the winner -CONST--0 year in a row after NE_person-3 's wicked ad for them last year .
i believe NE_person-0 be speak from the heart , that 's why i think it 's such an amaze and curious ad since it look and feel so much like the kind of thing the NE_person-1 campaign would find favorable to them .
NE_person-0 be a lifelong moderate conservative .
fiscal conservative , social libertarian .
vote for NE_person-0 -CONST--0 because the man promise to end the war .
his ENT_ordinal-entity-0 vote be for NE_person-0 .
he endorse NE_person-0 last time out .
have n't endorse anyone in that field yet , but say he like NE_person-0 .
he say he would n't call himself a hardcore conservative or an extreme lefty .
from the stuff he be for and against in recent year , it paint a picture of the kind of voter that will decide the election , and i think NE_person-0 taps into that feel of want to make a comeback happen .
there 's something to be gain by this guy 's performance , a man of rugged self @-@ reliance who also take the time to acknowledge in the ad that " we all pull together ", his tip of that of course to the bailouts which he be supportive of .
the candidate who will win the election be the one who can tap into that emotion too .
great ad .
its half ENT_temporal-quantity-0 in NE_country-0 and beer cost more because alcohol tax increase , your so hapy to be here at the game instead of your crowd house ( it 's be pack since your brother @-@ inlaw lose his job and home ) , your credit card bill be go to be major after the game , NE_government-organization-0 will be investigate you because of a glitch in the facial i.d . software at the enterance , your job be be outsourced next wek , your team be lose -CONST--0 in endorsement , a major corporation pay -CONST--1 to sell their foreign made ware to you for justt a few second , and your car be be repoed in the lot .
we need voter that be n't sway by gimmicky corporate ad .
i love the ad till i see that it be for NE_company-0 . consider they be own by NE_company-1 , " import from NE_city-0 " be a good slogan .
still a good ad , no matter who make it .
love the NE_company-0 one too .
there be high expectation , consider all the price they win with the NE_person-0 one last year , but i think they manage to pull it off .
i do n't even know ENT_amr-unknown-0 a NE_car-make-0 be but after last night 's commercial i 'm buy -CONST--0 .
i have a hankering to send someone flower via NE_company-0 too .
all and all , i think it be a very down year for NE_game-0 commercial and i do n't even notice the NE_company-0 one .
it be a bit too political for my taste but i do n't really care if car company want to spend a fortune on NE_person-0 ad .
i 'm a happy camper as along as i 'm allow to cast my vote for who i think be the better candidate and make my ENT_temporal-quantity-0 political contribution of $ 0.00 to all campaign .
NE_person-0 be inspirational .
at one time the repubs would have think so as well .
but they have become infect , and be really sick .
emotionally and mentally sick than anyone have be in this nation in my lifetime .
they be not team player , they be so individualistic that it have become detrimental to the nation pull together , work together .
they have take individualism to a degree that it go against the evolution of one of the most social animal in the world , the human be .
and " share " be see by them as socialism .
it really be sad , in its most basic sense , because it hinder fix what their " every man be an island " philosophy that be tear apart the fabric of society .
forget NE_facility-0 , forge the gulags , the NE_conference-0 -CONST--0 open that NE_country-0 make the queen and various sundry head of state sit through be just plain evil .
i always assume these sort of thing be appal .
if the queen be n't turn up this would n't have much coverage here .
a bunch of foreign look folk all in -CONST--0 place only get coverage if a crime be commit ( they 'll get blame , even if they be the victim ) .
there have be a small amount of coverage of mr NE_person-0 's problem , but since the ENT_government-organization-0 be n't go to charge him wiht anything it go under the category of ' NE_person-1 bluster '.
do n't you wish duel be still legal .
it would solve so many problem .
imagine NE_person-0 challenge NE_person-1 to a duel at the NE_organization-0 .
and NE_person-0 will have NE_person-1 as his second .
oh , happy thought..
actyooally , if a debt of honor be to be solve , there be no problem with , behind the tank shed at 4 or behind the bike shed after school , fisticuffs gadzooks , or in politico , s circle , in the duty free binge drink bar in the NE_government-organization-0 .
i be hope for dueling between member of rival street gang .
i 'll even provide nice hollow point ammo for them to use .
or something like the NE_sports-facility-0 .
-CONST--0 men enter , -CONST--1 man leave .
NE_person-0 , part of the NE_trio-0 die yesterday after battle leukemia for many year .
i grow up listen to their music and get the chance to see them perform when i live in NE_state-0 .
i remember this group , and love some of their song .
it be in the -CONST--0 s .
NE_music-0 dragon...
i can never hear that song without imagine an NE_gunship-0 or NE_gunship-1 @-@ 130 type NE_gunship-2 lazily swing around in a constant circle , with sci @-@ fi lasergun @-@ look tracer pour out like evil glow rain...
no wonder those grade school psychiatrist be baffle .
hey folk @- i just find out that NE_person-0 have an apparently small fire at her house this morning .
i just talk to her and she 's home and physically fine and deal with the immediate aftermath so be too busy to talk .
-CONST--0 do n't know when she 'll have or use internet access in the next couple of day , but for those folk wonder who they could wish well this week , you now have a target .
that poor girl have bust her ass fix up her house and install a new heater and wood stove for the last -CONST--0 month and probably longer .
that really suck ! :(
i hope she be ok and the house be still livable in especially since she encounter very cold weather and consider where she life and all .
thank NE_person-0 for let us know and -CONST--0 do tell her be think about her.:(
personally , i think they should peg it to inflation so that the pension have the same general purchase power over time , but i know that economically it would be a disaster as people be live more and more into their older year , far past when people would traditionally die .
the retirement age have not increase , but the amount of ENT_temporal-quantity-0 on retirement have .
eventually , the military will do away with retirement benefit , or at least certain aspect of them .
it be not the NE_country-0 alone .
ask me .
that be life .
they use you and then discard you !
soon one understand that , one shall remain happy .
i be happy !
yet if the govt do away with retirement benefit the world over , there will be peace .
none will serve !
NE_military-0 , you have me worry there for -CONST--0 minute as " they should peg it " mean to die .
service pension be " peg " to inflation but usually cap to -CONST--0 %ish per annum , not much more .
servicemen should be recieving..service pension and state pension and if they be lucky a work pension .
time be hard and the forecast for the near future do not look too rosy .
the retirement age in the NE_country-0 be due to rise in the future , at the moment retirement be -CONST--0 and ENT_government-organization-0 want to raise it to -CONST--1 .
i must say i also have little sympathy in this case .
assume h retire out of choice and be not wound , then it really be your own responsibility to handle your finance in my opinion .
the force be just a job like any other after all .
this very thing be drive home during my ENT_ordinal-entity-0 retirement class .
in the NE_military-0 you be require to attend the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 day of -CONST--0 week long retirement seminar .
the other day be optional .
but your choice not your unit .
around the middle of the day , the leader of the seminar start ask us if we be come back the next day .
about -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ( almost all combat arm guy ) say " no , we have thing we need to do at our unit ."
he say you all spent at least -CONST--0 yrs do thing for the corps . now take -CONST--1 week for yourself and be inform before you retire .
if any of you think that someone from headquarters NE_military-0 care about you once they kick you out the door talk to a retiree .
no one from NE_military-0 will call you to see how thing be go .
no -CONST--0 will call you -CONST--1 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 later to see if you have a job yet or if there be anything they can help you with .
and you know ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
no one ever do in an official capacity .
the only thing i ever get from them be a " we want you to come back on active duty as a full time reservist ."
you will have to give up your retirement and disability payment .
once we be do with you the retirement check won't start again until your -CONST--0 since you will be consider a reservist .
and you will have to start over from square -CONST--0 with the NE_government-organization-0 .
the NE_military-0 need you , do n't let us down ."
i have better thing to do .
i think i let them down .
all aboard be report safe .
aircraft drop in an apparent decompression state with passenger on oxygen from 40k in a controlled dive .
cause of the hole be unknown , aircraft be not old , be deliver in -CONST--0 .
i 'm sure that it must have be alarm for all concern .
the hole be enormous .
i fly out of NE_city-0 last week .
:( that could have very well be me !
despite now perform maintenance overseas , as NE_person-0 say in NE_work-of-art-0 , the only airline not to have have a crash ( jet aircraft that be )
and i have -CONST--0 client who work for NE_company-0 , -CONST--1 a NE_aircraft-0 long haul pilot , the other a aircraft engineer .
let me open with a brief reminder ( or history lesson ) of -CONST--0 of the reason -CONST--1 start watch this show :
now that be funny .
NE_person-0 be funny...
" NE_broadcast-program-0 " back then have ' ass @-@ kick ' interviews...
oh , yeah , and " NE_broadcast-program-0 " ( a wholy own subsidiary of NE_company-0 industries...)
now we have a sit vice @-@ president appear on this show...
grant , a new host ( and grant the -CONST--0 clip be n't from the original " NE_broadcast-program-0 ") but this be a news show ?
i 'd put in the NE_person-0 clip , only ' twasn't to be find on the intar @-@ tubes... how droll...
anyhow , ENT_amr-unknown-0 do the " NE_broadcast-program-0 " become such an institution of news that sit head of state would appear on such a thing ?
i guess it get gravity when lot of young kid start watch .
but you have to realize , NE_person-0 go on NE_broadcast-program-0 , NE_person-1 and NE_person-2 have be on NE_broadcast-program-1 , and every NE_political-party-0 candidate for governor go on NE_broadcast-program-2 .
NE_broadcast-program-0 be fun and very successful .
put pay to the whole o reilly fox crap that no one watch liberal .
NE_person-0 have a great job...he can give absolute free range to his opinion without any restriction that the regular news show have .
it 's no more a news show than NE_broadcast-program-0 , NE_broadcast-program-1 , NE_broadcast-program-2 etc.
it 's a comedy show that have some commentary , NE_person-0 would be the last one to say it 's news .
if anyone be use this a real source of news , they need to get out more .
but still , he make me laugh and most of the time i think he have good point to be consider .
i know this clip be older , but i think he hit the nail on the head regard most of the commentary show .
it 's supposedly news satire , though amusingly it 's almost just as informative if not more than the actual news show run these day .
obviously NE_person-0 have some political message of his own thrown in .
similar show appear in other country as people get sick of how every news talk show end up be either a pure propaganda 's machine for -CONST--0 particular side or a bicker debate that do n't make sense to anyone .
NE_country-0 have a version , though it use actor to cast as famous figure ( start mostly with political figure , but eventually end up with pretty much all sort of famous figure ) and they pretend to debate on a serious topic .
thursday there will be a vote on net neutrality...
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you feel about the NE_government-organization-0 get their hand on the internet ?
personally i have enjoy the only place for actual free speech...
do you want your internet censor ?
over my dead body ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!1
keep ENT_government-organization-0 away from the internet .
just read the actual law and the analysis .
this law be n't what it seem to be .
are they ever ?
the -CONST--0 rule of lawmaking be give the bill a name that be exactly the opposite of what it really do .
an emerge issue , ENT_amr-unknown-0 concern be you over drug violence in NE_country-0 ?
what potential do you see for drug violence to spill over more into the NE_country-0 ?
do you believe it to be enough of a threat that necessitate the NE_country-0 to take more action to do something about it , and if so , ENT_amr-unknown-0 action should that be ? ( e.g . border fence/wall , train for the NE_country-1 police/military , monetary aid to the NE_country-2 ENT_government-organization-0 , etc.)
this poll be intend for NE_country-0 .
the drug violence in NE_country-0 start when the mexican president decide to " get tough " on the drug cartel .
guess ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
they fight back .
just like the futile war on drug in the NE_country-0 , the drug war in NE_country-1 will have no greater success .
fight a war you can n't win be not noble .
it 's stupid .
stop fight the war on drug and the violence will go down .
we need to get the ENT_government-organization-0 out of the prohibition game once and for all .
legalize it , regulate it , and control it ( and tax it , too ! ) .
these drug killings be no different than NE_person-0 kill people during alcohol prohibition .
once drug deal ( aka beer , wine , and liquor sale ) become legal and regulate , murder in NE_country-0 drop dramatically .
plus we stop lock people up because they want to get drunk .
there 's more about this on my NE_blog-01-0 .
recently i learn about NE_person-0 's service plan , yeah may be late but better than never , and this be bother me .
accord to his website and other source -CONST--0 understand NE_person-0 's might mandate -CONST--1 hour of service per year when in college in exchange to $ -CONST--2 of tuition credit .
to add this his chief of staff NE_person-0 have confirm on -CONST--0 th nov to draft a plan in this regard .
further the follow be a quote form NE_person-0 's NE_book-0 ,
if they be just to be " ask ", then it sound like a great deal .
though if it be , i see zero reason to limit it to college student age -CONST--0 - 25. if it 's require it 's nothing more than a civil service draft , slavery .
might as well be forcing ' em to work the cotton...
either way , good luck get a bunch of drunk @/@ stone college kid to add that workload to their college and job workloads .
as long as their just ask
imo its a fair price to pay .
this come from someone that foot their own college tuition , no mommy and daddy allowences , no grant or anything else .
and it will keep them out of trouble and teach them some thing as well .
imo a good call and for some perhaps a way to look at thing in a much better perspective .
awesome , $ 40/hr , that 's more than what -CONST--0 make .
let ' see... -CONST--0 hour of service for $ -CONST--1 credit .
so for a -CONST--0 $ bailout , someone owe -CONST--1 hour ?
thats if they do not mandate... but if mandate... that 's communism... that the -CONST--0 step....
i think it be an excellent idea , people should be make aware of what to do in a crisis .
far to many people around the world today always expect someone to be there when a disaster strike , especially natural disaster .
here in NE_country-0 everyone be teach how to cope and survive for up to at least -CONST--0 day without assistance from outside .
i realize he be not in office yet...
day -CONST--0 .
NE_country-0 to move missile to NE_world-region-0 .
he 's already be test .
i 'm sure the NE_country-0 want to gauge his reaction .
i cannot help but recall the age old expression that youth and enthusiasim be no match against wisdom and treachery .
NE_person-0 get some clout as be the president elect of the NE_country-0 but i shudder when he go up against NE_person-1 .
was there a specific strike that stand out ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be NE_person-0 do -CONST--0 @-@ 2003?
NE_person-0 will have to do something over the top like the -CONST--0 previous president before him do .
this savagery seem to be a requirement to prove one have the mettle to be " tough ."
nevermind that really be tough be work out a solution that do n't require bloodshed .
negotiate an end to NE_organization-0 sanction with the NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 .
as far NE_person-0 be concern , i would rather wait for his cabinet appointees...
to make bold prediction on what NE_person-0 will do as president or what he will fail to do as president , one must wait to see who be the all the player .
would NE_person-0 have invade NE_country-0 if it be not for the gang of -CONST--0 ( NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 and NE_person-3 )?..
probably not , and probably NE_person-0 would have still be run the war in NE_country-0 as least have some influence there .
never mine , but a classic example of how " power corrupt and absolute power corrupt absolutely "
then , you be consistent with your view , and there be merit in that .
perhapes , others from the other side of the aisle be only seek consistency , as well .
i give you an explanation as to why he do what he do ( in part thank to us ) .
as an anti @-@ war person , of course what he do be horrible .
i would put it akin to napalm or cluster bomb .
the innocent be murder in a savage manner .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do the NE_country-0 need -CONST--0 aircraft carrier ?
we do n't .
that 's why we only have -CONST--0 .
smart @-@ arse .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do the NE_country-0 have -CONST--0 carrier .
because -CONST--0 be not enough ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 else can you muscle in on someone else 's turf ?
park a few carrier off the coast and make sure the despot do n't stray too far from the " NE_country-0 interest " angle .
you forget we also have -CONST--0 amphib carrier .
each one be as capable as any other carrier in the world . )
so it be in the paper today that the NE_family-0 and the NE_family-1 have meet up at the NE_facility-0 for a get together .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do that go i want to know ?
do NE_person-0 around and whisper thing to NE_person-1 like " see that security guard there ? thats NE_person-2 .
do not make him mad ! !",
" careful this floor board squeaks...cant sneak in late down this hallway "
or " theres a secret to get this door lock , see you have to push on the door while pull upward ."
do the bushs show them around ?
are they just give a map and let loose ?
can they decorate however they want ?
let say NE_person-0 want teal shag carpet in the oval office....can he do that ?
could NE_person-0 have the hallway paint neon orange if she want ?
do the kid get to pick their own room ?
will they have to share a bathroom ?
will they have to use a computer in the main live area so they be not accessing naughty thing on the internet ?
be the internet there block ?
could the obamas even access porn on the internet if they want ?
can the secret service hear thing from the outside of the door they be guard ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 if the obamas just have a personality conflict with a maid or something ?
can they just fire them at will and have a new one sent over ?
could they keep a pet giraffe on the ground if they want to ?
if they want to get rid of the bowl alley and put in a discoteque could they do it ?
do they have to put a " do not disturb " sign on their bedroom door , or can they just lock it when they want some undisturbed time ?
and do the secret service knock and wait for an answer or just go charge into the bedrooms/bathrooms .
i wonder if they have ever " walk in " on a president .
there be this really nice site on the NE_government-organization-0
very detail info and picture of most of the important room , span several era .
i think this show that pretty much every president can do any design thing they want with both the residence and the office wing
good question .
i too would love to know the answer .
i hope someone can help !
as per NE_broadcast-program-0 , the incoming first family get $ -CONST--0 to do any change to their live quarter of about -CONST--1 room .
also , any change that they can do be after consultation with historian , since ostensibly any change they would do would become a part of the nation 's history
that do not seem much , especially after consider the extensive change some previous president do .
not that i be complain ; thats my tax dollar that 's fund those lavender curtain
look like the NE_publication-0 have already start hedge its bet for a possible defeat .
i be surprise at this .
surely this be not the time to write down your won candidate
also , i do n't agree with the tone of the article that NE_person-0 's principled position be cost his this election .
do you think far right party like the NE_political-party-0 in the NE_country-0 should be accept as represent a decent part of society or should they be view as hate fill bigot ?
many work class NE_country-0 feel that the NE_country-1 be no long NE_country-2 due to too many immigrant .
be it racist to think this if you live in an area with more ethnics then brits like inner NE_city-0 ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do others think ?
do far right party deserve more respect or will they always be see as bigot .
yes it be .
in order to afford to stay in inner NE_city-0 , a person , probably along with his family , have to have a monthly income that support this .
in order to do that a ethnic , have to have a stable job and thus already prove himself worthy . / rant over .
generally speak the work @-@ class in a nation have negative view of immigrant because they 're at the economic margin and view immigrant as competition for scarce opportunity .
i do n't see anything wrong with the long @-@ term concern on immigration that many in the NE_country-0 may hold , but reform can be carry out through the mainstream party in NE_country-1 without have to resort to a racist @/@ fascist party .
if you 're concern about immigration from the NE_organization-0 , then withdraw from the NE_organization-1 .
it 's a racist @/@ fascist party .
it may have moderate its tune , but that 's what it be at -CONST--0 core .
fail coup have lead to this trial with NE_person-0 , NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 ENT_government-organization-0 's finger .
go to be lot of fun on this one .
accord to mannn the boss be NE_person-0 and an ex @-@ NE_country-0 member of the cabinet .
guy this one be go to cause beeeg problem for a few of the fatcats .
not many arm dealer pay for helicopter for the " poor of NE_continent-0 "
be it guilty conscience ?
will we ever find out the whole truth ?
i doubt it very much
i do remember NE_person-0 fly out and pull every string she could to get him this . consider NE_person-1 get -CONST--0 year and NE_person-2 won't see much less she save his life .
thank NE_person-0 for the NE_country-0
we have all see the stereotype the frenchman defeat by germans in NE_war-0 ungrateful to the heroic american who have their back in ww2 or the snobby french people whole ignore tourist who speak NE_language-0
but NE_country-0 be the NE_world-region-0 contradiction of the NE_world-region-1 prejudice view
NE_country-0 maybe a white NE_continent-0 ex @-@ colonial NE_world-region-0 democracy but by no mean be they right behind NE_country-1 or NE_country-2
when it come to do of think time and time again NE_country-0 have should the world
not all NE_world-region-0 nation be the follower of NE_country-0 as its be widely perceive
and i dont think the french will be demand that the chinese govt suppress the demonstration we have hear of in NE_country-0
after all the chinese people be do what tibetan monk and exile be fight for to do in tibet - freedom to protest
( though i must say the attack on NE_ethnic-group-0 people have take a bit of credibility from the tibetan monk )
you know there be -CONST--0 job -CONST--1 do n't want this summer and that be the NE_thing-0 .
rumour be now that NE_world-region-0 visitor be plan to protest during the olympics and consider the reaction today , we can expect a hell of a lot of kung fu .
that would be extremely distract when you 're on the look out for car bomb and NE_product-0 @-@ 47s .
did the NE_country-0 police state let NE_world-region-0 media see what be actually happen unlike in NE_province-0 ?
when rally happen in communist state they be rarely not state support activity
yay for the french...at least -CONST--0 NE_world-region-0 democracy oppose communist police state still .
the NE_country-0 be mostly only buy unlicensed copyright infringe copy of name brand french goods anyway .
if they stop buy american dvds it would only mean license one .
go on NE_product-0 they even sell the knock offs to us .
the uhygurs be mostly moslem and an ethnic minority in NE_country-region-0 with no self determination rule by a communist police state .
because some have join extremist group do not de @-@ legitmize the plight of an entire people .
i do n't under stand the problem people have with what be say by NE_person-0 .
in the NE_country-0 we have think communist regime be thug and goon since NE_person-0 in the -CONST--0 s right ?
i think those ok with the chinese police state be really ok with the $ to be make there and they be never concern about freedom only the spread of market capitalism .
the NE_country-0 be brilliant in adopt large scale no regulation market capitalism thereby co @-@ opting so many NE_country-1 who place capitalism and profit motive above a belief in democracy and freedom .
we really need to get out of bed with tyranny if we support freedom in the NE_country-0
or rather they do n't know ENT_amr-unknown-0 to use it .
the individual NE_province-0 have far more clout than the average NE_ethnic-group-0 .
the number of poster here tout how good the NE_province-0 have it be testament to that .
the problem be that the majority of NE_province-0 be nowhere near the centre where that clout could benefit them .
they be in their little village .
yes , you may get ENT_ordinal-entity-0 seat at NE_university-0 with far lower grades...
but you still have to study and go to NE_city-0 1 st .
if you 're stuck in your village , you 're sol .
the other major problem be that because that very few NE_country-0 citizen who be knowledgeable enough to challenge the municipal ENT_government-organization-0 be nowhere near the NE_province-0 .
even if the tibetans want to sue , they do n't know how and that open up to corruption and abuse since they know the tibetans won't take them to court over it .
i will be attend a meet with the NE_event-0 committee .
we have a parade on or about NE_event-0 in -CONST--0 down NE_road-0 in NE_city-district-0 .
we have be do this for several year now and have have many vary entrant include NE_country-0 prancer horse , re @-@ enactors in various uniform ( include ww NE_war-0 and ww NE_war-1 NE_country-1 ) , cavalry unit of various country ( the ww NE_war-2 NE_country-2 cavalry " man " be actually a pretty girl use the helmet to hide her hair ) .
we have a problem last year in that a NE_group-0 want to be part of our parade but we keep them out with the excuse that they only suddenly show up and do not apply to be a unit .
this year we be be " ask " to include an anti @-@ war unit in the parade make up mostly of people protest the war in NE_country-0 .
any idea on this ?
besides the initial mistrust of " not believeing " they will not disrupt the parade , unless they be willing to sign a document state they will honour the one who give the ultimate sacrifice , and give thank to the one who be currently fight to ensure they " can have an opinion " and not in anyway disrupt the parade....then i would say no they cannot join the parade.......
if they will sign say socument then welcome to the parade .
i would guess both group want to politicise the event , which be after all to honour veteran , not make a political statement .
if they want a political rally , they can organise their own ,
if they want to participate as veteran then nobody 's stop them from parade with their unit .
if they be n't vet , it 's not their right to parade .
with the trouble in the world economy , and the pound rapidly lose value against the euro , be it time for the NE_country-0 to adopt the euro ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the advantage of NE_country-0 adopt the euro , and ENT_amr-unknown-1 be the disadvantage ?
have the advantage or disadvantage change with the current financial crisis ?
it 'll cost a lot to do it which would not be advisable at the current time with the economic situation not look rosy ,
besides the people here would not stand for such a move .
so even if it make sense it would be political suicide to try and do it .
i just can n't imagine sit in a restraunt and order a human steak !
i 'm not even sure this url thing be gonna work but it 's a story about scientist grow meat in a vat ( stem cell research ) .
from NE_company-0 science news friday -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 @/@ 09 .
what do you think about this article/ if the url works... let me know .
vat grow meat instead of factory farm chicken/pork/beef ?
no more e.coli , NE_disease-0 , anthrax or NE_disease-1 to worry about .
seem like a good idea to me .
whats not to like ?
friend of mine in NE_country-0 have a whole cookbook full of recipe for long pig .
hell , -CONST--0 'd try anything -CONST--1 , but if -CONST--2 change my mind , bet NE_person-0 would be right there with a fork and a knife !
on this the -CONST--0 th anniversary of the attack on NE_location-0 , we remember all those that be still entomb there and their shipmate !
we be here because they be there !
it seem as each year go by , more and more lesson of history be forget !
our fearless leader 's children 's private school be observe the day by serve NE_country-0 food for lunch !
the NE_country-0 be observe this day as well by tell everyone that it never happen or we make them attack us because we would n't give them thing .
if you ever get the chance to to watch the documentary about NE_city-0 and the other NE_country-0 atrocity during wwii you will be shock to find a picture take of a NE_country-1 private bayonet a civilian and the interview with that very private say he do n't do it as do many of the NE_country-2 soldier who do thing like this .
sorry , no love lose for the NE_country-0 .
the NE_ship-0 be due to arrive yesterday however she be hold off an additional day due to high wind in the area and will arrive today at the inactive ship reserve at the former NE_facility-0 where she will reside for the next -CONST--0 year in mothball .
-CONST--0 year of service to the NE_military-0 .
now it be only a matter of time before NE_ship-0 retire and bring to an end the era of steam power NE_ship-1 's in the NE_military-0 .
they need to sell her for scrap and get rid of that float wreck .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 waste money maintain a ship that be in such bad shape , she could n't conduct air op before they decommissioned her ?
curious in part about how so many of the carrier get to be in . " poor material condition "
i 'm just confuse about the posibility of this happen can someone explain it to me ?
secondly wow have scrap and break gotten to be so expensive that its consider better @/@ more cost effective to do a sink @-@ ex wierd .
thats a massive amount of proccessed metal .
as more and more ship be build , the scrappers have more and more ship to scrap .
simply put , the scrappers be fall behind .
shipyard appear as manufacture plant ,
scrappers appear as junk yard .
plus there be glory in build wonderful ship , there be no glory tear the ship apart .
special occasion such as keel lay , ship christen , and commission ceremony deal with shipbuilding , no ceremony for scrap .
when you go to a store to buy a new shiny mop bucket , you feel happy to do so .
you feel lucky when you receive a new shiny roll of penny from the bank , you frown when its the old rusty roll of penny .
when you discard the rusty old mop bucket , you do n't feel sorry to do so . its people orient too .
since carrier cost so much , they be keep in service long .
many be of the age of old monochrome television set , or in the early day of color television set , you know the one without remote control .
you would n't think of buy a television without remote control today .
they be so old , they do n't make them any more .
with the carrier , they receive their mid @-@ life refit upgrade their electronics and electrical motor .
they have also receive their service life extension programs too , upgrade or replace their larger machinery component .
how ENT_amr-unknown-0 of us still have a -CONST--0 s vintage refrigerator , washer and dryer , dishwasher , television , automobile , hot water tank , range and oven , etc.
NE_country-0 offer warship to NE_country-1 for ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time
interest in that the NE_military-0 be plan to prematurely decommission its mhc 51 osprey class mine @-@ hunt NE_ship-0 .
as regard amphibious ship the NE_military-0 want desperately to decommission its steam @-@ power NE_ship-0 class ( NE_ship-1 will actually be decommissioned this fall ) .
these ship will soon start turn -CONST--0 year old with no NE_product-0 .
it be also say they have age much quicker than anticipate .
the NE_military-0 pour a ton of money into the NE_class-0 ship to keep them go for -CONST--0 year ( in some case it will be -CONST--1 plus ) w/o a NE_product-0 .
they dont want to repeat the experience .
eventually thsi may leave only -CONST--0 NE_class-0 ship until and if lha( r ) NE_class-1 ship get build .
also the NE_ship-0 class will be trucated at -CONST--0 ship imho( some say -CONST--1 others -CONST--2 and -CONST--3 have already be name ) .
this would also open up the possibility of prematurely decommissioning ship as many as -CONST--0 NE_class-0 ship now turn -CONST--1 year old .
sell -CONST--0 NE_class-0 ( plus grant -CONST--1 others as spare hulk ) and -CONST--2 NE_class-1 ship to NE_country-0 be intrigue imho .
this would give NE_country-0 a ready @-@ make credible amphibious force for very little cost .
with the demise of the battleship almost a certainty and only a handful , if any , of the NE_class-0 ship to be built( plus the truncate NE_ship-0 program ) the NE_military-0 be poise to cut its amphibious force by -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 .
the NE_military-0 be also attempt to fast @-@ track its seabasing platform which theoretically would make @-@ up for the draw @-@ down in legacy amphibious warfare platform .
more on that sometime in the future .
just my analysis of the situation based on what be available from open source .
it be a good start because it add a whole dimension to the indian arm forces....
can land force through these transport anywhere in the NE_ocean-0 ocean...
yeah , but i dont think it make that much of a difference...since we already have plenty of large land ships...which we can manufacture indiginously if necessary .
the land ship be something we can do without .
it be a very old decrepit ship that need a huge major overhaul to bring it up to today 's standard .
NE_country-0 would be better off buy a new ship with that kind of money .
NE_country-0 is buy NE_ship-0 ( lpd @-@ 14 ) .
not because of its war make capability .
but to move humanetarian aid in asian region like in case of tsunami .
NE_military-0 do not have big transport ship like NE_ship-0 which can land material on sea beach etc.
it only have magars NE_class-0 land ship . so if NE_military-0 get this ship , then i think it be ok .
at least it will get a cheap ship for do mostly humaneterian work .
war make will be secondary work for this ship .
and this is the only reason that americans have suddenly agree to supply NE_country-0 this particular ship .
regard agis radars .
it be a seperate item .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be you discuss it on this thread .
ENT_ordinal-entity-0 let us buy this ship , then we can discuss others .
this be what happen when you take shipboard safety for grant .
tank be always dangerous .
ive be in many and hate every second of it .
i get deride and laugh at alot for the seemingly overcaustiousness i always undertake .
people die if you dont .
i prefer not to die thisway.:
tank be very dangerous place .
we be always teach in first aid @/@ rescue never to enter a tank if there be someone unconsious inside...
cause you would be next .
unnecessary tragedy .
-CONST--0 read a story relate to the clean trychlrothylene use to clean a tank in the rn back inthe 70 s , the guy be around it too long that his mylenin ( the fatty cover around the spine ) be eat away by it and he go bonkers for a few hour and then die .
hell you have to take alot of caution when you be work in closed area with noxious fume , even build model you can get mess up off the paint if you dont have an open window .
yank out , bomber in , -CONST--0 bomb , -CONST--1 kill , control battle start , sunnis v shites , -CONST--2 of dollar @/@ pound spend , life lose , for what , for sweet fuck all that 's what ,
NE_country-0 force have no chance of control ,
NE_country-0 be gonna get worse now than before the NE_world-region-0 try to make it better
the innocent be gonna suffer just like before .
let get out of ag as well leave the village tribal idiot to it .
if push come to shove , slash n burn , waste no more life n cash on useless campaign 's . imo
do this surprise anyone ? exclude our glorious leader of course
imo , the NE_country-0 's screw themselves by give into the sadrists and others .
as mention before the NE_country-0 should have punch his ticket and his army of idots before depart NE_country-1 .
once again politics interviened and spare their sorry ass .
this be what they get in return for that stupid decision .
the large " gray area " know no boundries . and once you let religion into politics instead of keep them seperate the black and white disappear depending upon who you be and only gray exist .
a very dismal commentary .
there be no doubt that repeat deployment in the combat zone do wear out individual . it do lead to whole lot of man management and domestic problem .
and it do create innumerable problem for the govt which ENT_government-organization-0 maintain its aim and deliver .
a catch 22 situation .
that the troop be still manage speak very highly of their dedication and patriotism and they should be commend .
to overcome this problem , -CONST--0 way could be draft .
but that would be a political suicide .
also , a draft will not guarantee that the soldier would be better .
in fact , many misfit would be in , lead to greater problem as be see in NE_country-0 .
-CONST--0 of the solution be to have a volunteer force of all nationality like the NE_military-0 ( be discuss elsewhere in the forum ) .
all say and done , a difficult situation indeed , but the national aim cannot be forsake !
it 's just one person 's point @-@ of @-@ view , but from ENT_amr-unknown-0 i can tell , there 's lot of fight leave in these guy .
-CONST--0 'm around NE_government-organization-0 's warrior all day every day , and -CONST--1 can tell you that they do n't seem tire and worn out to me .
-CONST--0 stat -CONST--1 keep see thrown around be the approval @/@ disapproval rate of ENT_amr-unknown-0 the war be be conduct .
but if only -CONST--0 of the troop like the way we 're go about the business of win in NE_country-0 , that do not necessarily mean they 've lose faith in the mission .
hell , as for myself , i 'm not crazy about ENT_amr-unknown-0 we 're proceed , either .
but that do n't mean i do n't believe in the mission .
far from it - i want to go at the job hard . i want to win .
i want the surge to be big , soon , and to last as long as it take to win .
so , although it 's only my perspective here and back by absolutely no number , stats or fact other than what i know from personal observation , i simply do not see the impending crash come .
what i can tell you that i do see be a frustrate will to victory , and a sense that our leader and people be not as commit as we be .
NE_person-0 , this repeat turnover and its effect i understand to some degree since we ( NE_military-0 infantry unit ) be always back in the ci grid after every -CONST--0 year .
if we be send without this break , i be sure we would have get really feed up .
as it be , we have start have problem inspite of this -CONST--0 year layover in peace station , since the standard of live have go up and our troop be get urbanised and soft .
we also have the advantage that we be from the same unit for life in most case and so the cohesiveness be more and we know each other well .
i believe in the NE_military-0 , soldier can be post to any unit .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the time gap between turn over for NE_country-0 ?
you 'd have to work around them to truly understand what i mean .
otherwise , i just do n't think you 'd really be able to see it the way i do .
in my job , i work with all the inter @-@ agency player , and i never experience the kind of inertia and drag with anybody else .
this be absolutely the truth : the NE_government-organization-0 wonks down here do not want to be associate with the word ' kill ', as in my branch 's mission of ' capture or kill enemy high @-@ value individual '.
that 's what we attempt to do ; that 's what they want no part of .
and you 'd have to be here to know ENT_amr-unknown-0 it be to be frustrate and impede by people that vehemently object to your very existence .
i wish i could express it in a way that you would know what i mean .
( you probably think i 'm just impatient with bureaucracy , which i be , or that it 's a squabble about method , and there 's certainly those , too .
but it 's more than that.)
then , i think , you would not think it too strident to say they have an antipathy toward an NE_country-0 victory .
NE_person-0 , i have n't work inter @-@ agency , so i trust you know best .
however , in their defense , i would like to mention that
1. the pinstripers have n't be exactly beloved or respect by the NE_person-0 ENT_government-organization-0 .
some of this be fair ( NE_government-organization-0 be all but ignore in -CONST--0 ) , some of this be not ( bureaucratic irritation at the initiative kick them out of comfortable perch and into NE_war-0 hotspots ) .
2. NE_government-organization-0 have get plenty of ex @-@ military , and there 's enormous pressure to get more .
i trust that i break no state secret by tell you that if you head over to NE_facility-0 , you will see a lot of -CONST--0 @-@ somethings and lot of -CONST--1 @-@ year old senior staff , and not much in between . the lack of a middle be really make ' em push for ex @-@ military to fill that .
i can assure you that patriotism be high up on their value , more so than ever .
i 'll try to explain my perspective on all this .
it might ramble at time .
i be for the war , still be if it could be fight properly , but it can n't be .
NE_person-0 's goal be a NE_country-0 , with a ENT_government-organization-0 gov't that can police the country and be an NE_country-1 ally in the NE_war-0 .
this will not happen .
my knowledge be all ENT_ordinal-entity-0 hand , but that 's all i have to go on .
i 'm see a picture of a nation of subhuman savage .
did anyone ever bother to ask ENT_amr-unknown-0 NE_person-0 do the thing he be hang for ?
we 're see the answer to that question .
these people need a dictator who 's willing to use mass murder when they step out of line .
unfortunately we be n't prepare to use similar tactic , so this war be unwinnable .
if it be up to me , everytime an ied go off we 'd get our people out , draw a circle on a map with at least a 500m radius around the point of the blast , and turn that area into a smoke crater .
and i do n't care if there 's a school full of kid there with class in session .
do that a few time and these " people " might start to behave better .
we can surge troop all we want , but if the level of cruelty do n't increase it will all be pointless .
that 's the only thing they understand .
i can n't believe i be stupid enough to buy all the tripe about what NE_country-0 could become if we just remove the dictator .
i also have some problem with NE_person-0 that i do n't have when i vote for him , based on his piss poor performance .
he 's recently change policy to go after the NE_country-0 agent that be supply the militia .
we 've see story that the NE_government-organization-0 have be track these NE_country-0 for over -CONST--0 year .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 change now ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do n't we whack them as soon as they were identify ? ??
ENT_amr-unknown-0 NE_country-0 be dead or maim because NE_person-0 be play some diplomatic footsy game with NE_country-1 ?
there be -CONST--0 of our border agent in prison for do their job , and -CONST--1 marine sit in jail in NE_city-0 for hit the wrong house after they be attack in NE_city-1 .
NE_person-0 have n't lift a finger to help either of those group of men , and that 's why imo NE_person-1 have show himself to be nothing but an honorless pig .
can someone talk me out of this ?
because it 's look pretty damn bleak to me .
ieds : the lazy man 's insurgency
it 's time to take another look at NE_country-0 , because there 's be a big change in insurgent tactic in 2005. that 's inevitable . war make people on both side think faster . peacetime army never learn anything ; wartime army learn new trick faster than a hungry raccoon .
the big change be that the insurgent have decide to rely on ieds rather than ambush with shoulder @-@ fire weapon to kill the -CONST--0 or -CONST--1 gis per day they figure they need to wear down the NE_country-0 public 's will to stay in the fight . and it 's work , way too well .
the stats be clear : ied victim make up a bigger chunk of our casualty every ENT_temporal-quantity-0 . over the last -CONST--0 month , ieds have cause -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of NE_country-0 combat death . last ENT_temporal-quantity-1 ( -CONST--2 -CONST--3 ) be typical : out of -CONST--4 NE_country-1 troop kill , ieds be responsible for -CONST--5 .
compare that with -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , a terrible month when we lose -CONST--2 troop . back then the insurgent relied on rpgs and small arm . only -CONST--3 of our -CONST--4 kia that month @-@ barely more than a -CONST--5 @-@ be kill by ieds .
the insurgent have decide to do it the easy way . as long as they can use ieds , their low @-@ tech standoff weapon , ENT_amr-unknown-0 should they risk close combat ?
the real question be why they can get away with it . and here @-@ well , i hate to keep say this , but somebody need to . the reason they can do it be because we still have no intel on them . it 's the biggest failure of the war , and nobody talk about it . ci warfare be about people , not hardware . we 're all hardware and no intelligence , like a NE_person-0 show . make me sick .
that make the decision to go with ieds a no @-@ brainer for the insurgent . in the standard ambush , the kind we be face -CONST--0 year ago , the insurgent detonate an ied under a convoy , then open up on the stall survivor with rpg and small arm fire . it probably make them feel good , sort of their version of shock and awe , but the rifle fire be ineffective and by concentrate their force , the insurgent make themselves vulnerable to our air power .
the problem in any guerrilla battle be the getaway . anybody can pull a trigger ; the trick be get your men home safe , while enemy chopper zoom through the sky and every street be full of troop and armor look for men of military age . that 's the tough part .
an ied ambush have none of those risk . only -CONST--0 man need to be on the spot @-@ the triggerman . he detonate the ied from a car park down a side street and drive away before the occupier can even start their search . no risk . no casualty . very demoralize for the occupier , especially since they know damn well that everybody in the neighborhood be in on the attack but they can n't level the local ' shack like they 're die to .
what make this wave of ieds worse be that the device be get more effective . frankly i 've be shock at how good the NE_country-0 be with these thing right from the start . i mean , after that shameful performance in NE_war-0 , do you expect these bastard to be so sneaky , patient , and smart ? i know this war be a bad idea , but even i never realize what we 'd be up against .
the scariest tech development of all be that the insurgent have learn ENT_amr-unknown-0 to make shape @-@ charge ieds . to understand ENT_amr-unknown-1 shape charge be such a powerful weapon , we have to go into the incredibly cool world of explosive physic . i love this stuff . i mean , ENT_amr-unknown-2 red @-@ blood NE_country-0 boy do n't experiment with explosive ? the only reason i ever open my chem book be to see if it mention tnt or dynamite in the index . ( it do n't @-@ goddamn hippie teachers.) and naturally i use the local wildlife , like toad and bee , in my experiment with the kill power of firecracker .
what -CONST--0 learn be the most important point about the subject : blast alone do n't do a good job of kill the target . a bee would wobble off unhurt after -CONST--1 of my -CONST--2 th of -CONST--3 daisycutters go off right next to it .
now before you hothead whose hobby be make pipe bomb in the garage write me angry letter ( or send me long round package with no return address ) , i know a blast can kill , if it 's a big enough blast . we have a really nasty example of that in -CONST--0 this year , when a huge ied kill -CONST--1 NE_military-0 near NE_city-0 . from what i 've read , investigation show there be nothing special about the ied . it be just -CONST--2 anti @-@ tank mine stack in a pile @-@ the NE_company-0 of ieds , i guess you could call it .
that ambush show real clearly how important intelligence be in guerrilla warfare . the same unit that suffer the ied attack have just have -CONST--0 of its sniper kill in a small @-@ arm ambush . now you tell me ENT_amr-unknown-0 anybody can ambush -CONST--1 sniper unless they 've completely penetrate the unit . the insurgent know where the unit 's sniper would assemble , and they know where the vehicle would be pass . we do n't know a thing about the enemy , but it 's clear that he know way too much about us .
the other problem be that the -CONST--0 NE_military-0 be ride in -CONST--1 of those ridiculous land craft the NE_military-1 use as apcs @-@ in NE_city-0 , -CONST--2 of click from the sea ! it 's call the NE_vehicle-0 , and it look like a giant armored dinghy . since it be design to ferry troop ashore , it sacrifice armor and speed and damn near everything else to an amphibious capability that have no use anymore . but that 's the NE_military-2 for you . real brave , but not always real smart .
maybe if those guy have be in a real apc some would have survive . i can n't say . if the blast be big enough , it can kill even an mbt . the pal take out -CONST--0 NE_country-0 merkavas , the best @-@ armored tank in the world , with simple blast ieds .
but most of the time , guerrilla do n't have the delivery system to depend on blast power . if they 're try to kill soft target @-@ i.e . people @-@ they pack the bomb with homemade shrapnel : roof nail , ball bearing , anything that 'll shred flesh . a suicide vest tip with nail be basically a -CONST--0 @-@ degree -CONST--1 gauge .
to kill gis that way , you need to catch them off @-@ guard , somewhere NE_military-0 feel safe . that 's what happen when a jihadi kill more than a dozen of our guy in a mess hall in NE_city-0 while they be have lunch -- minus their body armor .
in the field , NE_country-0 troop be a hard kill , especially because they move in armored convoy protect by chopper . and that 's the real beauty of ied attack for a guerrilla : they absolutely nullify NE_country-1 air power . there be literally no target for the attack chopper . the pilot know damn well that -CONST--0 of those NE_country-2 car drive away from the scene be carry the guy ENT_amr-unknown-0 set off the ied , but there 's no way to tell ENT_amr-unknown-1 -CONST--1 .
in a strange way , we 're look at a 3d war . we control the air , but the NE_country-0 literally control the underground , thank to these buried ieds . we fly , they dig .
the insurgent ' first ieds be simple . not that there 's anything wrong with simple . the weapon that have be hurt us be all simple , like the rpg . simplicity be the guerrilla 's friend .
those early ieds were usually just shell bury by the road , wire up to a detonator . lot of amateur be tinker in their garage , or whatever NE_country-0 have instead of garage , play with stuff that go boom . and naturally lot of those guy go boom themselves .
like i say , war teach people fast , but some of the lesson have to be learn by the next of kin , not the handyman whose bright idea for a new type of bomb turn him into an abstract paint all over his wall .
sometimes an insurgency have to learn its lesson several time . take the case of pressure @-@ trigger ieds . these be basically standard anti @-@ vehicle mine , with something like a bathroom scale as trigger . people and car can pass over them unharmed , but if a really heavy ( mean armored ) vehicle roll over that scale , the bomb go off . ( truck be a problem . some truck weigh as much as an apc.) the best part be that you do n't even need a triggerman to set it off . you can all be off at the hookah parlor polish up your alibi when it go off .
the insurgent in NE_city-0 use pressure bomb in -CONST--0 , but they usually fail to go off . their bombmakers do n't have the technique yet .
thank to info @-@ share , the internet give an insurgency , they 're back at it , with better wire diagram . -CONST--0 week ago ( oct . -CONST--1 ' 05 ) , a pressure bomb shred a NE_vehicle-0 in NE_city-0 , tear -CONST--2 gis leg to piece .
the first ieds be mostly mortar round that fail against our armor . so the insurgent go to big -CONST--0 mm round . that 's a big , big shell and when you trigger it at the right moment , it 's go to kill almost anything but an NE_vehicle-0 .
the NE_vehicle-0 be a great tank , so it 's kind of scary to read the stats on how many of them the insurgent have manage to knock out . as usual , the invasion be the easy part and the occupation be when thing get lethal . we only lose -CONST--0 m1s in the conventional fight , but the guerrilla have since manage to disable 80. now most of those be track damage , but that 's enough to put a tank out of action .
the good news be that the NE_vehicle-0 have live up to its rep for crew protection . the NE_military-0 's NE_military-1 say only -CONST--0 crew have die in ied attack on m1s . ( -CONST--1 other NE_vehicle-1 crow have be kill , mostly by sniper fire , ride in open hatches.)
so if you 're an insurgent bomb @-@ maker , your goal be to find a way to kill m1s . not just knock a tread off , but destroy it and kill the crew . and that 's where the shape @-@ charge ied come in . shape charge be develop for tank kill , use in mbt anti @-@ armor round and antitank weapon . their warhead be basically thick cup of soft metal . metal with low melt point , usually copper . the bomb @-@ maker 's job be to make sure as much of the force of the blast be channeled to the copper cone as possible . so sometimes he 'll put several -CONST--0 mm shell beneath the copper , or pack a whole lot of tnt under it .
when the ied detonate , this copper cup turn into a shaft of superheated metal that can zip right through any armor , even an NE_vehicle-0 's . that 's what they tell me , and i have to believe it .
it 's the kind of weird science that use to frustrate me in physic , the sort of info you just have to take on faith . i can n't help wonder if they 're kid us civvies about it all . i do n't get why a soft metal like copper can penetrate NE_product-0 armor , which can defeat almost any warhead around .
apparently the copper be n't even actually melt . it eject as a solid ; it just " behave like molten metal." i 'm sure the insurgent NE_broadcast-program-0 tinkerers do n't understand the science involve any more than i do . they just hear that it work and try it out .
the NE_country-0 countermeasure have be pretty lame so far . convoy travel with jammers that make it harder to detonate the ied by cell phone or garage door opener @-@ NE_company-0 and NE_company-1 sale be go to drop in the NE_local-region-0 . but like i say , low @-@ tech be the guerrilla 's friend . these day they 've go back to wire , and i hear some be even use string . you can n't jam a string .
beyond that , NE_person-0 policy be to blame NE_country-0 , or NE_country-1 , or NE_person-1 or whoever .
NE_country-0 ? maybe . NE_country-1 ? no way . NE_country-2 's scared to death , ready to do anything to make NE_government-organization-0 happy . and if it be NE_country-3 , ENT_amr-unknown-0 can we do about it ? there be still a few neocons so totally out of their little gourd they want us to invade NE_country-4 . i have to wonder if they 're agent of dr NE_person-0 , programme to destroy NE_country-5 . because invade NE_country-6 would do it , it 'd end us once and for all .
this blame stuff be a sign of frustration . nobody know ENT_amr-unknown-0 to stop ieds , even with all the NE_magazine-0 geeks send in their garage @-@ tech brainstorm . that 's because @-@ damn , ENT_amr-unknown-1 time do i have to repeat it ? -guerrilla war have no technical solution . or even military solution . the only effective ci technique be torture , reprisal and , ultimately , genocide .
my guess be that genocide will come back one day . that be how the ancient dealt with rebellious town : wipe ' em out . one of these day some first @-@ world country be go to get impatient and a problem child like the NE_local-region-0 will be a big , radioactive ghost town .
if we do n't do it , the kurds may end up do it the old @-@ fashion way they learn from the turks : -CONST--0 bullet , -CONST--1 village at a time . it 's be do before -- seen any NE_country-0 up there lately ? probably not , but most of " NE_country-1 " use to be " armenia." a few of the NE_country-2 make it to NE_city-0 , but the rest be bury up there .
we 're talk about NE_country-0 here , the place where war be invent . -CONST--0 of people have be wipe out forever in those part . all these NE_event-0 lobbyist get furious if anybody say NE_religious-group-0 be n't the only tribe to get genocided , but that 's just politics-" our genocide be better than your genocide ! "
the fact be , genocide be , historically , the most common result when one tribe run into another . and something tell me the next big wipeout will happen right there in central NE_country-0 .
it have a large sky be fall slat but decent read on the ieds...
it be true that the ieds be effective .
it be not a " lazy man 's insurgency " but a " cunning and diabolical man 's insurgency "
NE_person-0 ,
sorry , as i state , i do n't have much time , but the wife now have the newborn .
a few superficial criticism :
1. it 's not ci ( counter @-@ intelligence ) . ci be when you thwart your enemy 's intel operation . thus , gain intel on when @/@ where the insurgent be plant ieds be intel , not counter @-@ intel .
2. iraqis do n't have garage at their house . thus , i would conclude that this guy have never step foot in NE_country-0 .
some meaty criticism :
1. the NE_military-0 's NE_vehicle-0 be as armored as the standard NE_military-1 apc - the m113. it sound as if this pundit be probably a former NE_military-2 guy . based on the damage to the NE_vehicle-1 that be involve , unless it be a NE_product-0 , more armor would n't have help . that 's how big the ieds be get .
2. a single -CONST--0 mm round do n't do any significant damage to NE_country-0 armored vehicle ( the up @-@ armored NE_vehicle-0 be n't a true armored vehicle in the sense that it be design from the ground up with armor in mind - it be modify from a cargo vehicle ) . for example , on the NE_vehicle-1 , a -CONST--1 mm round will scratch some paint off and flatten tire .
3. war be like a sport . it be interactive and tactic , technique , and procedure evolve continuously in reaction to your opponent . back to the sport analogy , if you 're get kill in a zone defense , you switch to man @-@ to @-@ man , etc. he seem to apply a template that the enemy of the NE_country-0 should be dumb and not react . underestimate your enemy be a bad and dumb thing to do .
4. he fail to mention the intel that we get that allow us to defuse the majority of ieds before they be detonate .
5. he fail to mention ENT_amr-unknown-0 switch back to wire device make it easier to catch the trigger man .
6. he fail to mention how use larger device mean that you need to spend more time prepare the site , which mean a greater chance of compromise .
7. he complain about intel , but then advocate harsh technique that run contrary to the value of the NE_country-0 and do n't weigh the impact that these technique would have on gain intel from the population and @/@ or bring the population off the fence and to our side . his recommendation would result be less intelligence - gain some information from a pay triggerman may result in a few short @-@ term success within a particular cell , but it will alienate the population and result be less intel over the long @-@ run from the population and future cell that would be create down the road due the increase perception of occupation through the harsh technique he advocate . as an example , NE_city-0 , which be the direct result of a half @-@ dozen irresponsible individual that be able to conduct their abuse due to the lack leadership of their supervisor , have a huge negative impact on our relation with local NE_country-1 . the trust we have build with many be erode and our ability to gain trust with others be much more challenge .
bottomline , he do n't truly analyze the situation from all aspect and use some faulty assumption and some fact that be flat out wrong . in the end , you have the action @-@ reaction @-@ counteraction cycle that be produce bigger ieds that be easier to catch , but more deadly if you do n't catch it . i 'm not state that it 's not a problem , but this analysis do n't offer much value .
i hope this help . as far approach to coin , i 'm sure that NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 , and some of the others on this board ENT_amr-unknown-0 militaries have be do coin for much longer than the NE_country-0 ( ENT_amr-unknown-1 , btw have do coin quite frequently , but then shun it as a freak occurance and do n't internalize the lesson learn in favor on focusing on the " big threat ") can comment at length on ENT_amr-unknown-2 this article espouse the wrong approach to the problem .
i 'm just wonder ENT_amr-unknown-0 NE_country-0 poster think your ENT_government-organization-0 's reaction would be if NE_country-1 ask for finish nuclear weapon and missile , plus nuclear know how , with you for under the table shipment of yellowcake for your nuclear weapon program ?
you see , i 'm hope that one day befor it be too late that NE_country-0 will wake up to the fact that we can n't rely on the NE_country-1 to be willing to lose a city over NE_country-2 by hold true on the ' nuclear umbrella ', if ever we have a conflict with NE_country-3 .
by ship you yellowcake from say a secret source on defence land acqured for ' train ', we could keep it outside the NE_treaty-0 inspection treaty process so you can build bomb with it .
we ould even fly in vet NE_country-0 miner ( with train ) to avoid the secret get out here . it would benefit us by allow payment to be make outside our budget approprations process , which be transparent .
once we have our missile we can announce that we be join you in the non @-@ align movement , transport weapon grade uranium between us openly and generally ignore all the complaint -CONST--0 would generate and other people war , just like you do now .
do this work for you ?
it would n't be that hard for NE_country-0 to build nukes by yourselves .
involve outsider usually increase the amount of headache you have to deal with .
imo , every " ENT_ordinal-entity-0 world " - technologically modern nation could probably do it today - some have choose not to ( like NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 ) perhaps because of history ?
i think NE_country-0 probably could -CONST--0 if they want too , and the rest of the world would n't object as much as they would if -CONST--1 of the historically agressive non @-@ nuclear nation do it .
a lot of the nuclear weapon tech that be unattainabe -CONST--0 @-@ -CONST--1 year ago be attaintable now . it would be very expensive , and there would be consequence .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 should we sell ?
the only reason we would be if we really need the money or if the yellowcake be not available elsewhere or if you be the only -CONST--0 who have something we really need from an existential perspective as barter .
-CONST--0 could and would probably work if NE_country-0 be to place their own nukes under indian control onto NE_country-1 soil .
for your defense and our own .
expand deterrent .
but then you have that option already with the NE_country-0 , so the fact that you ask this question probably point to a drift in confidence or the fact that you feel you would be able to better control an NE_country-1 nuke umbrella to your prime advantage versus a NE_country-2 one .
tired of the ever @-@ hulking , always @-@ advance glacier of dvd and bd case in -CONST--0 live room , i 've procure a media server and a NE_product-0 box to run it .
my plan be to migrate all of my media ( probably about -CONST--0 dvds and bds , count all the tv show i have ) onto the server over the next year or so , and banish the hardcopy to a closet for backup .
media server with 6tb storage run NE_product-0 life in the basement , NE_product-1 box hook into NE_stack-0 ( plasma , bd player , cd player , cable box , receiver ) life upstairs , NE_product-2 network .
so far i 'm get great quality playback from some item , but real movie that i 've rip be not great .
i 've play with a few different programs , but i like NE_product-0 the most so far .
do anyone know if it 's really a " bit - to - bit clone ", or be i get some default compression even if i 've set that to -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ? -@ NE_person-0
if there 's a visible difference between the dvd and the copy then it 's be compress .
sometimes the format you decide to convert it to have issue .
i seldom do it so i 'm not really au fait with what be good but the software i NE_software-0 and convert it to either.mov file or uncompressed mpeg4
nifty thread .
i be think of implement a rather lower cost option .
manually rip all dvds to mkvs , make a little htpc with a low cost NE_product-0 cpu and a wireless card and hook it up to my tv .
for any gamers out there.. the rumor thread for " NE_game-0 "..
ENT_amr-unknown-0 the game would be like ?
so far its a split between semi @-@ scifi( NE_game-0 ) or literally modernwarfare2( NE_game-1 ) with new map and missions..
NE_game-0 be a disappointment when they decide to go back to the same old NE_war-0 theme..
i 'd personally prefer them add new map and mission to cod4...
NE_game-0 to me be the best real @-@ war based fps...
maybe more ' politically bold mission ' like NE_province-0 , NE_world-region-0 , NE_country-0 , nwfp/waziristan..maybe even cuba/n.korea..
just hope they dont overdo the NE_world-region-0 theme which they pull off so well in NE_game-0
if it be " semi @-@ scifi "( they 're rumored to be look for a sci @-@ fi title ) ..
i 'm stumped..
ENT_amr-unknown-0 'd they possibly pull @-@ off semi scifi without look like a bad copy of halo..
they should do some type of geurilla warfare game set in a wartorn NE_continent-0 or NE_continent-1 country .
that could be interesting , like a NE_game-0 .
i hope they make the plot as interesting as the last one .
somilian pirate @/@ mexican drug cartel would bear the hell out of me .
ps : NE_game-0 be pretty good .
i do n't know why people hate it so much .
NE_game-0 - -CONST--0 word - awesome ! !!...
the trailer look great .
plus i get what i want - an extension of NE_game-0 instead of yet another NE_war-0 scenario .
look like they pack a lot more mission into NE_game-0 compare to NE_game-1 .
i be so look forward to -CONST--0 !
this be so much better than last year when i see the NE_game-0 trailer ( flamethrower and all ) and all i could think of be - " oh dear..."
since many of our troop be stuck in NE_country-0 , it be likely that we may not have the resource to be able to send troop to NE_country-1 .
so there be great likelihood that NE_country-0 may act alone .
although NE_country-0 have greater air and ground superiority then NE_country-1 have larger number of troop and have long range missles that can reach NE_country-2 .
NE_country-0 in the past have sucessfully fight off nation with larger number of troop before a prime example be the six day NE_war-0 .
so would NE_country-0 be able to act alone or would NE_country-1 military intervention still be require to attack NE_country-2 ?
NE_country-0 would find it hard enough to conduct air raid on NE_country-1 , let alone fight a large scale war .
the distance be simply too great for NE_country-0 to be able to project much power against NE_country-1 .
i do n't think NE_country-0 could act alone .
if they attack NE_country-0 unilaterally , it would probably be a large mission aim at take out NE_country-1 's nuclear infrastructure .
they would have a hard go of it .
NE_country-0 in retaliation would launch its long range missile at NE_country-1 , as well as encourage NE_political-party-0 to harass NE_country-2 .
i think any NE_country-0 action against NE_country-1 would involve bring the NE_country-2 into the war , i think its the only way NE_country-3 can really do enough damage to make the whole effort worthwhile .
i have be search for sometime now , and i can n't seem to find a dropshipper that sale merchandise low enough so i could profit from it .
would someone -CONST--0 help me ?
hi , nobody be go to give you their source .
you be go to have to find them on your own .
there be plenty out there but most of them be more trouble than they be worth .
there be also a very few that be good supplier but you have to realize , when dropshipping , the profit margin be very thin and you have to be on top of them all the time , monitor their inventory .
people find a dropshipper , sign up and then list , list , and list !
they list soooo much but then when it come to monitor the inventory they do not check back into the site to see if the inventory be still available .
you can have a successful business with dropshippers but it be w*o*r*k .
it be not e*a*s*y .
i find all my source by surf the net on my cellphone during commercial , while wait in line , any spare moment .
search several different way , most do not even have the word " dropship " on their site .
good luck .
and beware of " membership club " such as NE_thing-0 and the like .
they be not your solution .
real distributor do not charge you for take your money .
still , make any drop ship work in the NE_feedback-0 @-@ orient quick ship ebay world will be a challenge .
-CONST--0 do a quick search and you will find ton of info on drop shipping...here be a thread from the recent past -CONST--1 : //forums.ebay.com/db1/topic/building @-@ -CONST--2 @-@ -CONST--3 @/@ -CONST--4 @-@ -CONST--5 @-@ drop/5200052702?#msg5200760329
which be only of about 25+ since the begin of the year .
i be sorry but until NE_company-0 pin the drop ship topic all you can do be search older post .
i cannot give you the formula for success , but i can give you the formula for failure -- which be : try to please everybody . NE_person-0
my partner and i refuse to use dropshipping .
if a dropshipper have -CONST--0 item for example and we sell -CONST--1 to -CONST--2 different people then we have -CONST--3 potential unhappy customer with the potential for -CONST--4 negative feedbacks .
a dropshipper be only concern with sell their -CONST--0 item as fast as they can .
i be concern with sell the -CONST--0 item that be in our inventory as best and correctly as possible .
this be just my opinion.....
ok...i know the answer to that but it still really bother me .
this be what be wait for me when i log into NE_product-0 this afternoon
no ! NE_company-0 should issue a coupon for buyer to use on our listings and get -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 off....
we would still get our full $$ and NE_company-0 can give the seller the difference that the buyer save !
just really bug me
because that be additional revenue outside of seller .
seller be captive revenue that will be about the same no matter what they do ,
until someone else come along and challenge ebay NE_company-0 will keep on do the same thing , but soon or later that will happen , , , .........i hope soon
, ...,most people do n't realize that the best answer be the one that they do n't want to hear . NE_person-0
yup..i know the answer but still hate it !
sorry , long story .
first off a little info..
NE_company-0 have be one of the lead guitar amplifier company for -CONST--0 year .
many of the older amp be be restore and also there be countless company offer clone and cloned replacement part for diy'ers .
since i like wood work i think some folk would enjoy an amplifier shell that they could finish themselves and either use it to restore an old NE_company-0 amplifier or to collect aftermarket part from countless other vendor and end up with a vintage NE_company-1 clone .
so , i have have pretty good luck sell these wooden amp head shell in the past and think i would reintroduce my product .
well , NE_company-0 pull my list for have the word " NE_company-1 " in the title .
my actual list read " NE_company-0 style plexi @/@ NE_product-0 headshell for project ."
notice the word " style ".
i do a quick NE_company-0 search use " NE_company-1 style " and come up with -CONST--0 's of listings that use that term for after market part and kit .
the listings i click on be not actaul NE_company-0 product .
i also search another famous amplifier company and type in " NE_company-0 style ".
again -CONST--0 's of listings for aftermarket part and kit .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be i singled out ENT_amr-unknown-1 there be -CONST--0 's and -CONST--1 's of people list this way ?
and its clear that i do not claim it be an NE_company-0 " product which be why i put the word " style " in the list .
do not seem right .
people who be look for these item won't find them without know that it be for a NE_company-0 or NE_company-1 style amp .
i love the smell of package tape in the morning .
can n't use the manufacturer 's name in the title unless the item be list be actually make by the manufacturer .
NE_company-0 rule - not mine .
NE_person-0 's right - someone somewhere decide to report you , and you end up get a wrist @-@ slap .
you -@ could @- start report all the " style " listings you find and ( hopefully ) watch them go away .
sometimes it only take -CONST--0 report... sometimes you gotta stay on top of it for a while .
there be special rule for what you want to do , offer non @-@ brand replacement component ( in your case , the wood case ) .
unfortunately , i just do n't recall ENT_amr-unknown-0 they all are...
there 's a way to word the description that work and do n't get you slap for " keyword spamming " ( which be what put NE_company-0 in the descriptive text will earn you ) .
fun stuff , eh ?
that sound right...
as long as it do n't fall into the not allow category by meet this criteria :
use " compatible with , " " fit , " or " for " before a brand name in the title of your list to describe item that be universally compatible or that be compatible with an entire product class
just know if it be someone that be " after you " ( which sometimes happen ) - there be always some violation that you be break or you be near the questionable portion of break some policy .
because NE_company-0 will usually " pull ENT_ordinal-entity-0 ask late " when a list be report , your listings will only become better and you may just sell more because of ENT_amr-unknown-0 you learn on ENT_amr-unknown-1 to become a better seller as you refine your listings .
if you keep a good sense of humor and communicate with ebay... NE_company-0 will start " ask ENT_ordinal-entity-0 pull late ".
hello ,
i wonder if someone can clear something up for me ?
-CONST--0 have a £63,950 svr mortgage with NE_company-0 with 19 -CONST--1 @/@ 2 year leave . ( it 's currently £64,570 due to some stupidity a few yrs ago ) .
now , this be originally take out as interest only but when i 've phone a couple of year ago to increase the payment they have change it to " part interest , part repayment ". not too fuss about this as -CONST--0 've work out the number and the correct amount be come off the capital every ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
i 'm go to contact NE_company-0 for detail on how to make overpayments as i 've increase my direct debit again but would like to be able to make ad @-@ hoc overpayments ENT_amr-unknown-0 i 'm able to .
thing i 'm curious about be the -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 overpayment thing - i know my mortgage agreement be subject to this however ENT_amr-unknown-0 do it really mean ? should i only be pay -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 more than my interest only payment or be it -CONST--2 ENT_percentage-entity-2 extra off the capital ? my new direct debit ( as of end dec -CONST--3 would take me over the -CONST--4 ENT_percentage-entity-3 of io payment ) .
i 'm guess they will give me a rough idea of ENT_amr-unknown-0 i can overpay in £s based on my current direct debit but would be interested to know beforehand just for my knowledge .
currently NE_company-0 have on their record that " pension " will be pay the capital off at the end of the term - these be currently non existent so try to get myself at least on track for repayment at the end of term .
thank very much !
its -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the mortgage balance for the year , so if your mortgage balance in £100,000 that year you can overpay by £10,000 during the course of the year without penalty .
however , if you be on the svr you dont have the -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 limit , just overpay as much as you can comfortably afford
quote :
are you sure you 're on svr ? or just a rate that be soon to end ?
have work for NE_company-0 it be indeed correct that once you 've reach the svr then no overpayment limit be enforce you be simply free to overpay as much as you wish to .
this be correct . your kfi @/@ mortgage offer may say something along the line of ' in any -CONST--0 year you may repay up to -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the amount outstanding on your special rate product '. it 's a roll -CONST--2 month , so the year start when you make your ENT_ordinal-entity-0 overpayment . so , you could n't pay £10k in -CONST--3 and another £10k in -CONST--4 for instance , you 'd need to wait -CONST--5 month .
then , once your ' special rate product ' end , you go onto svr , with no overpayment restriction .
hi , i 'm in the middle of a divorce and am try to take on the mortgage on the family home .
i 'm only try to borrow about -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of my home 's current market value , which be about -CONST--1 my ENT_temporal-quantity-0 income .
have approach several big lender and try go through a financial adviser , but noone will lend because my income be make up of : -CONST--0 very part @-@ time job ( -CONST--1 employ , -CONST--2 self @-@ employ ) , maintenance ( not yet court order ) and tax credit .
their argument be that once my daughter leave school some of these income source will cease , but by then i would hope to be back at work full time ( she 's only 7!).
the mortgage rate i 've be quote be less than i 'm pay at the moment anyway !
it 's be suggest to me that i try and take out a personal loan instead ?
anyone get any suggestion ?
you would think that have -CONST--0 part time job that at least you will have 2 at any one time and that be more secure than have -CONST--1 full time job and possibly be give notice to leave .
it sound like you be self employ and will need the assistance of an accountant to create some book that show some decent profit combine all the source of income stream as -CONST--0 source of income .
they may be do an affordability calculation instead of a income multiple and do n't think you can afford to pay for day to day live expense and a mortgage .
i would get another financial advisor who can help you .
someone should be able to lend you the money .
hi all , i currently have a mortgage which what use to be NE_facility-0 .
i take the mortgage out in -CONST--0 , fix rate for -CONST--1 year .
this be due to finish in -CONST--0 .
i do n't know what to do !
i take the mortgage out with my then husband , we split -CONST--0 year ago .
he do all the money side of thing so have no idea ENT_amr-unknown-0 to go .
i have a funny feel that since house price have drop , i be likely to be in negative equity .
we borrow more than -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 , retrospectively a stupid thing to do .
i have take the mortgage on on my own .
any advice would be gratefully receive , thank you .
in rate term , there 's nothing you can do .
if you be in negative equity as you seem to think , there be no prospect of another lender take you on , so a remortgage be n't go to be possible .
NE_company-0 which be the body manage your mortgage do not offer replacement or customer retention product , so your mortgage will revert to the follow @-@ on rate set out in your original NE_thing-0 ( kfi ) or mortgage offer .
this be likely to be the standard variable rate , currently -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 .
given theat the current lend and borrow siatuion , it be more difficult for people to get a mortgage .
i understand that martgage broker be to be able to see from a lot of provider .
but for people be dififcult to get mortgage today , be their advise be worthy...
say for instance they say it be better you ask for this provider but in fact , when you afollow their suggestion , you get reject ?
be not that it be better to sticj to your bak who know wel your financial stability and ability ??
i undesratnd that some mortgage adviser be free of charge .
i be ask here because once you get reject it will seriously danage your credibility to get another lender ?
opinion and expereince from people in ths forum be really appreciated....
first of all i disagree that its hard to get a mortgage...compared to the day of -CONST--0 %+ mortgage yes but for the right applicant there be plenty of lend available .
obviously i be biased as i be an independant mortgage adviser but my view be it be good that we can source the whole market find the best deal and know the specific lend criteria of each lender .
i use to work for a bank and i would never offer my service to my friend and family as i do n't know whether there be better service elsewhere .
now i be comfortable do thing for my friend and family .
bank will want you to think that you have a better chance of get a mortgage with them as you have your finance with them but this be simply not true .
if you get reject you need to look into the reason why...affordability..credit score etc
hi my husband and i be look to buy the hosue we currently live in , but we do not have a deposit .
are there any -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 mortgage out there and ENT_amr-unknown-0 one be the best to look at -
i be totally useless when it come to thing like this and hubby be no better ! !!
-CONST--0 currently earn about £21k -CONST--1 year and hubby earn just under £15k -CONST--2 year .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be the likelyhood of us get a mortgage to start off with and be go to be more difficult to find -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 one ?
any advice would be appreciate . thank
whats the value of your house ? ,
hows both your credit rate ?
this seem to be the -CONST--0 most important factor when consider a mortgage other than your joint income .
the chance of get a -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 be probably impossible to be honest...
a share ownership property be one where you do not buy the property outright , but only a percentage share of the property . for example only -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 .
however on the remain -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 which be still own by the house association , you will pay a ENT_temporal-quantity-0 rent .
so if you be not look at this type of property , you will not get a -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 mortgage .
hello all - just join and after some advice .
-CONST--0 've see the post on the forum relate to the NE_company-0 consent to let and subsequent hike in interest rate by -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ( this be go back -CONST--2 year or -CONST--3 ) .
at the ENT_temporal-quantity-0 my wife and i be rent out -CONST--0 property and have sign up to a -CONST--1 year fix rate mortgage .
we initially live in the property but subsequently let it out have receive permission to do so from NE_company-0 .
given we be in a fix rate mortgage and have pay for the extra security i be pretty shock and appal that they be force this increase on us .
in any case my wife go to NE_company-0 to discuss our option with the mortgage adviser .
the long and short of it be that the mortgage adviser give the advice that give base rate be -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 and we could move to another lender on a formal btl mortgage for a far lower rate ( give with the -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 increase our NE_company-0 rate would be over -CONST--2 %) and therefore over a the mortgage term more than cover the early repayment fee .
this advice make perfect sense so we pay to come out of our fix rate with NE_company-0 and move to another lender - the early repayment fee be circa £3k .
subsequently we receive the letter from NE_company-0 ( as i be sure many do ) say that those on fix rate mortgage that would have to pay early redemption fee would not have the -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 increase impose until the end of the term of the fix rate .
given the advice we receive and subsequent redemption fee we pay ( prior to NE_company-0 change their mind ) i wonder whether anyone think we have any recourse against NE_company-1 .
be very interested in any thought .
many thank
it definitely sound interesting .
i would certainly go to the branch , speak to someone in management and present this letter along with any documentary evidence that you may have have from your previous meet .
also get them to produce the note of your previous meet with the mortgage adviser .
we come within a gnat whisker of pay a 7k early redemption fee to avoid the -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 hike .
thankfully the letter arrive -CONST--0 day before our completion date on our new mortgage so we be able to get out of it .
only -CONST--0 month until we can leave NE_company-0 and move over to a proper btl mortgage .
are there any bridge company ENT_amr-unknown-0 'll do a loan for an uninhabitable property ( it 's derelict )?
we need to borrow -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the hammer price until we can get plan permission for restoration which will allow us to get a mortgage
( verbal approval of our plan have be give by the local plan officer and the build society in question ) .
( excuse me while i do a little - this be a build we nearly buy through normal channel -CONST--0 year ago , get gazump on and never think we 'd ever get another crack at it ! )
it do n't seem likely and would be horrendously expensive .
look at it from the lender 's point of view :
this be high risk - if you do n't get plan approval the site could actually be worth a negative amount ( due to demolition cost ) .
verbal approval be essentially worth nothing .
on the flip side there be little return for the lender as you do n't want the loan for long so not much time to charge interest .
really you would be better off : get a mortgage not a bridge loan ( also difficult ) . get an unsecured loan to buy it initially .
be aware that almost no bank or build society will give a mortgage on a property after it have be buy , if it be buy less than -CONST--0 month ago .
i do n't know the answer to your question , but it sound very risky to me .
you will be take on a costly short @-@ term loan based only on verbal promise which may not eventually come good .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 happen if the b soc do n't eventually make an offer , or it 's at a much lesser amount than you hope for ?
do it know that the house be uninhabitable - usually that make a property unmortgeable .
or if the pp take much long to be consider because there be objection / -CONST--0 's refuse and you have to appeal etc ?
last time we get a thread like this , i suggest NE_company-0 and the op do some research and find the cost be prohibitive .
i echo the other comment about how you deal with be unable to remortgage if something go wrong and would ask you to note you 'll have to stick with the bridge finance for around -CONST--0 month as you won't be able to apply for the remortgage until you 've own the property for -CONST--1 .
caution need .
bridge be only possible where the lender believe you will live elsewhere .
they cannot lend on a property you will be live in as this then fall into NE_organization-0 regulation , which bridge be exclude from .
an alternate to bridge be a non status mortgage , but the lender will still need to survey the property and carry out the nusual due dilligence to include full legal conveyancing and check .
the reason most aution deal be cash be that lend be never guarantee and can fall through at the mast moment , mean the applicant loose the property and thier -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 deposit .
you 'll need a good deal of luck to get this through use lend .
also bridgers usualy want a clearly define exit route , and it wont be sufficient to say a remortgage should be possible subject to all manner of property repair ( ENT_amr-unknown-0 if you fall ill / go mad / get depress part way into the renovation for example ) .
hi all , current mortgage fix deal end in -CONST--0 and this will be the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time remortgaging .
purchase the property -CONST--0 -CONST--1 .
the property be value at £102000 when we purchase it and we now owe £77000 .
i be interested in learn more about how valuation work when remortgaging .
do they come round ?
are there any way i can improve the potential result ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 happen ?
nothing much have change since last valuation in or out the property .
to be honest i would be happy with £102000 valuation but guess we will find out .
any information anyone can provide about this process would be great .
are you remortgaging to a new lender , or do a product transfer with the current one ?
if it 's the latter , chance be your current lender will use a desktop system call NE_system-0 .
if you be move your mortgage to a new lender , it will normally ask a surveyor to visit the property to establish its value .
as you be right on the -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 borderline for the better product , i would imagine an inspection would be better for you .
talk to your current lender before you start shop around .
it 's be solve now .
thank for everyone
ENT_amr-unknown-0 on earth would you allow somebody else to sort out payslips and p60 for you ?
if you have proof of income ENT_amr-unknown-0 not provide it ?
you have be complicit in any fraudulent application by allow it to happen with full knowledge .
struggle to see how you could compain to the lender and cab when you apply fraudulently .
i suspect you be now register as a fraudulent applicant and will struggle to gain finance anywhere .
hi , i 've a dilema !
look to remortgage , and have find suitable product from NE_company-0 . £195 non @-@ refundable application fee , conveyancing and valuation free .
it be a -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ltv .
my house be worth very close to the -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 mark .
if i apply , and the valuation come out lower , i 'd have to pick the next best product , which be actually NE_company-0 .
NE_company-0 value for free at £180000 , which be the amount we estimate it to be .
mortgage balance be £134000 , so as you can see , very close to the -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 .
i could just go with NE_company-0 ,
no fee , but would cost me additional £1700 over the -CONST--0 year fix term .
do i risk lose the £195?
i suppose only i can answer that , but any thought or tip ?
you appear to have do the maths and identify the pitfall .
if there 's no way of avoid that fee , you appear to have to risk it .
be n't there a product with no fee you could choose upto -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 so you 'd lose nothing if the property be downvalued ?
lender i have speak to say that while their valuation fee be ' free ', you still have to pay for it but it be refund if you go ahead .
i guess it 's not always the case ( only speak to -CONST--0 lender , and perhaps -CONST--1 only discuss it with -CONST--2 of them ) .
it 's one of the reason why i 'm not remortgaging at the moment - found a great -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 rate but could go the wrong way of the house be value lower than expect .
just to also say , NE_company-0 be quite strict on affordability too not just ltv ,
their online affordability calculator be quite close .
NE_company-0 be not as strict .
good even people ,
was look for a little advise in regard to the possible mis @-@ sell by a -CONST--0 broker of a -CONST--1 .
my partner sign up for a -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 intrest only mortgage with the nothern NE_company-0 mortgage but to realise it be a intrest only mortgage some -CONST--1 year down the line .
the reason i feel that may have a case to be answer be that surely mortgage company must take some precaution when sell an intrest only mortgage
i.e the customer must take out some sort of endowment to ensure that when the mortgage intrest be finally pay off then the customer would be in a financial position to pay of the actual amount the mortgage be agree for ? ??
the mortgage broker who advise obviously have a case to answer but be nothern NE_company-0 in the wrong aswell ?
any information that can be offer would be greatly appreciate .
no , there be not .
read the paperwork she get when she take out the mortgage - it will explain that you need to set up a repayment vehicle for the capital amount .
i would also be amaze if the broker do not also advise her of this .
unfortunately this be quite a common problem , particularly with young ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time buyer who have no real clue about mortgage .
this be a problem during the boom year in that bank be not check if customer have a repayment vehicle in place , hence they be throw these interest only mortgage at people because that 's all they could afford because house price be so high .
there be people on here who will deny this ever take place .
many people put a lot of faith in some of these broker in the belief that they be act in their best interest .
unfortunately there be probably little come back because ultimately your partner should have read closely what she be get into before she sign .
i know that might sound callous but there be the say that cover this which be ' buyer beware '.
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do we go from here ?
some stock have have a great run since early -CONST--0
be it time to cash in and wait for the next drop or have we bottomed and its a steady rise from here ?
i would like to here from anyone who see the last recession , late eighty , pan out and how the sector react .
i view chart from then ,
it show volatility till ' 92 before a general steady rise although different sector behave differently
any thought appreciate
quote : agree with NE_person-0 .
-CONST--0 think we 'll be rangebound for quite a few year .
except there be a good chance that commodity and commodity stock will spike violently upwards for a while in -CONST--0 year or so ( higher than they be in -CONST--1 ) , thank to supply destruction which may well have a coil spring effect .
also inflation and a fall dollar should help them go up as well..
there be also good reason to believe that commodity will rise over the long terma s well .
hi , ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time post so -CONST--0 bear with me !
i be due to receive approx 20k from sale of decease parental home and need to find somewhere to put it .
have use up my NE_product-0 allowance ( so have hubby ) may need to access all our fund within the next -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 as we will either be move home or do self build if nothing suitable come on market .
therefore need to be able to access fund without too much penalty/notice .
have -CONST--0 kid and wonder if i could put money in children account for better tax free interest or do you have any suggestion -CONST--1 ?
thank in advance for any help
based on what you have say , you should not invest but stick to savings .
check out the usual table on this site for interest rate .
if you put money into the name of your child it become his beneficially .
in any case see -CONST--0 : //www.hmrc.gov.uk/tdsi/children.htm for tax treatment of interest on money give to children by parent .
you could always hold the cash in an on @-@ line account ( NE_company-0 pay -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 gross ) until -CONST--1
then each of you can put £5640 into a cash NE_product-0 ?
hi an elderly relative ( late -CONST--0 s life in annex adjoin the house ) have bank with NE_company-0 all her life - and she ask me for some general advice .
i wasnt at all familiar with her financial situation and she have in the past been advise by NE_company-0 .
what appear to be the case be that she have : £150k+ in an oeic @/@ share NE_product-0 with NE_company-0 £30k in easy access savings account pay -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 with NE_company-1 £15k in current account with NE_company-2 £5k in cash NE_product-1 with NE_company-3
what struck me be that she have all her savings in NE_company-0 @/@ NE_company-1 so well over the £85k protection limit .
also that she have be advise to put so much in oeic @/@ corporate bonds/shares isas as it appear her capital have be fluctuate ( generally down ) .
she invest this whilst in her -CONST--0 s so am struggle to see ENT_amr-unknown-0 it would be good advice to ask her to put so much in a scheme where capital be not protect .
anyhow we have book an appointment next week to go through this with me in support .
do others think this advice be strange ?
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 would others advise .
my instinct be to get her into good savings account where capital be not at risk and to split it across -CONST--0 different institution ( it seem you can can get -CONST--1 %+ if you keep an eye on the rate be offer ) , plus make sure she use all the NE_product-0 allowance each year
any thought @/@ comment would be appreciate ? NE_person-0
i 'd be reluctant to start mess with an elderly relative 's finance .
others in the family might accuse you of all sort when she die .
that say : 1 ) if she 's of sound mind you need to understand if she 's prepare to move from NE_company-0 or not .
another bank may confuse her significantly .
2 ) if she want to stay with NE_company-0 , support her in find the best home for her money from -CONST--0 range , but also help her to keep it in a good pay account , as most of their account have -CONST--1 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 bonus .
3 ) make sure you do n't do anything with cash NE_product-0 that could impact her stock and share -CONST--0 .
4 ) get her agreement to shift money from the current account to a better savings account ( even if it 's only the -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 one ) .
just because somebody 's old do n't mean that capital should be protect .
my big concern for her would be if she own a property .
there 's a high chance of an iht bill on the horizon .
i 'd be talk to an ifa about the best way to mitigate this .
as NE_person-0 suggest , the share will effectively be in her name and be n't relevant to the protection scheme .
this be a very tough one .
bank generally will do what 's best for them which be invariably bad for the customer .
there be a lot of evidence these be some of the worst route to market due to them often have the highest cost .
as mention though , change be never fun , especially when it could be confuse and misunderstood .
i would personally say she should find an ifa and pay upfront for advice ( ie no commission ) so she get what be most suitable for her .
given her age it 's standard practice to have less money in equity and more in guarantee income than she currently appear to have due to short term fluctuation .
i 'm probably go to get criticize for what i 'm about to write , but as a long time lurker on these forum i know that i can also expect some sensible and honest opinion .
i have be have a relationship with a married man for some time now and i 'm start to get feed up with the situation and wonder if this be all it 's ever go to be .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 likely be it that a married man would leave his wife for the ' other woman ', ENT_amr-unknown-1 do i know if he 's serious about me or just toying with me ?
i know he do love me , but that 's not always enough be it ?
i be really tear at the moment whether to let thing carry on , or to walk away .
likelihood of him leave his wife for you , slim to none .
even if he do could you live your life happily ?
if he can do it to his wife , would he have qualm about do it to his girlfriend ?
1. the person you be have the affair with be cheat on his wife .
if he do it -CONST--0 , he could do it again - remember the old say " when a man marry his mistress , it leave a vacancy - for the next mistress ".
2. quite simply , he be cheat , you be cheat .
there be all the excuse in the world " he will leave when the children be older @/@ when his wife be better @/@ when they 've sort out finance - just wait for the right time to tell her " blah , blah blah , blah !
if you have any integrety , you would walk away now .
are you in a relationship with anybody ? or be you single
he 's have his cake and eat it at the moment ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would he want to give that up ?
i 'm struggle for idea as to what to do for my birthday this week .
dh will be at work , ds at school and dd at nursery till -CONST--0 pm unless i choose to take her out for the day so i can go somwhere till 3.15pm .
in some way i envy my dh who have a -CONST--0 birthday that generally fall within school holiday and we be all around him with good weather .
on mine its generally dull , rain or cold and everyone be work .
this year i 've thougth and think about what i can do either on my own or maybe with my almost -CONST--0 year old .
my mum suggest i go over with her to visit my dad who 's on a house sit and have a sandwich with them at lunchtime and open my pressie .
this seem to be my best option but its not what i would choose to do or really want to do .
my parent have choose to do this house sit , i really dont mind but i 'm not sure -CONST--0 want to go over , walk the dog and sit in a stranger house for a couple of hour to pass the ENT_temporal-quantity-0 .
any thought -CONST--0 on what you grow up do for -CONST--1 birthday when the weather be rubbish and your friend be work .
i dont expect to be entertain and happy to potter around or go to a national trust/swimming , but my local pool doens't have an open swim on thurs suitable for my availability and i do n't have a car free to drive .
hmmmm....... its quandry !
chalk it up to one those thing that happen when you have kid and do something at the weekend instead .
mine be on the -CONST--0 th .
( NE_person-0 : have -CONST--0 have the money , -CONST--1 would have go off for a couple of hour and a coffee at the nicest garden centre near to where -CONST--2 live so -CONST--3 could get there by bus )
go for a meal with your dh in the even after his work , and get your parent to babysit ?
day time wise - how ENT_amr-unknown-0 money do you want to spend ?
get your nail @/@ hair etc done ?
depends what youre in to .
i dont normally do anything in the day time for my bday ,
id do something at the nearest weekend or that night .
i 'm try to muster some sympathy for you but i 'm sorry i really can n't .
my birthday be in -CONST--0 too , and most year -CONST--1 have to work . for the whole day ! !!!
this year , i work all day , could n't celebrate with my dd because she be work in the even , so i go out for a bite to eat with a couple of friend and then on to see a film .
i 'll celebrate my birthday with my dd when we both have some time together... in -CONST--0 .
your parent want to see you and spend some time with you , give you a present so be gracious ( and a bit mature ) and go !
hi , i be get marry on -CONST--0 -CONST--1 th -CONST--2 and i be plan on buy a gift for my wife to be .
she love NE_company-0 and i buy her the chunky link bracelet with heart in the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 few month that we be together so now i be think to get her the necklace .
be the official NE_company-0 uk website the only place to buy official and not fake item or be there other place that sell NE_company-1 ?
plus anyone else have any other similar idea ? ?
look at NE_company-0 and NE_company-1 but i 'm not sure....
sound lovely .
the only place to buy genuine NE_product-0 be the website or NE_company-0 shop .
the only place to get NE_product-0 be the airport shop abroad , if the exchange rate/ duty free combination work in your favour .
have the match necklace be a lovely idea .
if she like charm you could get the NE_company-0 sweetie bracelet - then you have the next few present sort out for the charm .
oh come home from work on monday even by taxi and find -CONST--0 men try to break into the house .
they set upon him , knock him to the floor and kick him several time in head and stomach , stole his mobile phone and bag and run off .
the police come out very quickly , do a drive around with oh and the cabby but do n't see them that night .
they take dh 's bag ( which they find dump a few street away ) and say they would forensically test it , and there be a cctv camera which cover the area and the cabby say he could definitely identify the men as he get a clear view .
dh have not be ask to give a statement , and we assume nor have the cabby .
he get a letter in the post this morning , ENT_date-entity-0 tuesday , say the police be close their investigation .
the detective in charge have n't answer phone call and his bag have n't be return to him , which contain business paper and clothe .
dh do need treatment at a and e after the attack
it seem pretty clear that the police do not bother with forensic test and may not even have check the cctv footage .
be there anything which can be do to challenge their decision not even to do a preliminary investigation into an attempt burglary and common assault , where there be witness to the attack ?
if it be relevant at all , dh have no previous conviction , arrest or anything similar with the police , and be a middle aged businessman set upon by -CONST--0 year old male of a different racial background to us .
no , something be wrong here .
they can n't just ' close an investigation ' the day afterwards , not have even take statement .
i 'd say get some legal advice , or write to the police , state what you 've put in your post above and ask for an explanation .
you could try post this on the moneysaving in marriage and relationship board ?
you might get more answer there .
i would get down to the police station soon than just write a letter .
if cctv need to be examine and have not yet be look at , you want it seize asap , before it be record over .
it be of course possible that the cctv be n't work on the day in question but i be still surprise no other forensic examination have take place .
if a full note of your oh 's / the cabby 's evidence be take in a police notebook then the need for an immediate witness statement be reduce .
if this be really true , start here : -CONST--0 : //www.ipcc.gov.uk/en/pages/default.aspx
but ! be prepare to be stop for motor offence by disgruntle copper for the next -CONST--0 or so years........
make a formal complaint .
the police be try to fiddle the figure .
was it even record as a crime ?
ask for the crime number and see .
i 'm actually v excite as it all seem like fun , but all ex leader be v cynical ?

hi all i be look for advice -CONST--0 .
dd1 be in futher education -
because the course she want to do be n't available near us she be in residential college and we pay her accommodation and food cost ,
it leave thing very tight , but as we feel this be a great opportunity for her we be prepare to do it .
she also have the use of a car as its easier ( and a lot cheap ) than us drive her back and forth most week .
dd2 be due to leave school next summer and be hope to start a hairdressing apprenticeship .
she start to talk about drive lesson ( a bit premature i know ) and us buy a car and pay for petrol and insurance .
i mention to her that as she will be earn an income it will be time for her to start pay us towards -CONST--0 keep , etc.
she think that will be very unfair as we be still pay for her older sister .
any suggestion -CONST--0 - we be prepare to take the money and put it away for her future ( although i would n't admit that to her as she would want it sooner rather than later ) .
i do see her point , but be not prepare to let her get away with not pay anything .
thank for read .
do her sister earn any money ?
if she do n't , then you could speak to them both about the contribution you expect from them when they both start earn .
as for the car - did you pay for dd1s lesson ?
it seem unfair to not pay for dd2s if you do , and then to allow access to the car .
i do n't see why she would expect her own car if her sister share yours , although you will have to think about priority for who need the car and what you will do if both want the car !
let her get away without pay anything won't teach her anything for the future , but equally if she does't get the same treatment as her sister she 'll probably feel quite upset .
my grandaughter be in the final year of -CONST--0 of a hairdressing course ,
she have to work part @-@ time in a salon but do n't earn very much and the stuff she have have to buy @/@ keep replacing for the course have be very expensive.. so my daughter have have to help her by not actually take any keep money as long as she be on the course..
its meant my grandaughter have manage to pay for all her own clothe , fare , lunch , and go out money over the course..
my daughter be happy that she 'd find something she want to do and be able to near enough support herself through it..
as i say at the begin as an apprentice she will be earn peanuts..
i agree with what be be say tw .
to support dd1 to the tune that you be and then to expect dd2 to pay into the household on what i 'm sure will be a much less than minimum wage apprenticeship seem like a double blow to dd2 to me ! and i can appreciate her frustration .
i do think that whilst dd2 be do her apprenticeship she should be allow to retain -CONST--0 wage .
you should explain to her that this be your way of ensure that they be both treat equally in what be very different circumstance .
however i would also make clear that once either of them begin to earn a full time wage outside of college or apprenticeship that they will be expect to contribute to the house if they continue to live there !
i wish you well .
i 'm sorry but i can see your dd2 's point -
you say you would support her if she go to college but even though you agree that the apprenticeship would be a better career choice you 're prepare to penalise her for it .
if she be leave school to get a normal job i would agree she should contribute but this be basically her still study , just go about it in a slightly less conventional way .
have she arrange to apply for this herself ?
that to me show a lot of intitative and motivation for someone her age ,
rather then take the more mainstream option of college she have look into her option and gone for what will be best for her future career .
apprentice wage be extremely low so while she be on those could you maybe look at a compromise -
eg you will still provide her room and board ( the same as you be do for her sister ) but she have to pay all her expense out of -CONST--0 wage , ie -CONST--1 travel to work , lunch there if she need them , phone if she have it , any expense she need for work .
hmmmmmm hard one here !
normally i would say yes , take a nominal amount from your dd2 as she be now " work ", but as you be support dd1 , i can see why she might be cheesed off .
i guess it depends on how much she be earn during her ENT_ordinal-entity-0 year as an apprentice......
let say , for talk sake , it 's £100 -CONST--0 week ,
that 's still a lot of money for a school leaver who have no household expense or food to pay .
personally -CONST--0 would take a small amount , say £20 -CONST--1 week from her and , as you say , put it in a savings account for if she do decide to go travel in the future .
explain to here that it may not seem fair , but she be now earn , and the cost of this compare to live away from home , be minimal . or show her a breakdown of what a -CONST--0 @/@ -CONST--1 of all household cost would be .
in regard to the car , do your dd1 really need one ?
of course it be easier for her to get home at weekend , but can she not get the train / bus ?
when i be at uni , i think i could count the number of student who live away from home and have a car on one hand - the rest mnade do with a young person railcard .
and will your dd2 need a car ?
if the answer if no , neither of them really need it then i would suggest that they share the car ( -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 on / off , for example ) .
a car for a teenager / student , be an expensive luxury and with the rise cost of insurance and fuel , most parent cannot this for -CONST--0 child , let alone -CONST--1 .
if that be the case , after the child be born , the father will go to the mother 's home , and present the family matriarch with gift , ask to be accept as the father .
it 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .

1 . NE_organization-0 . to be train accord to the NE_show-0 and pay accord to the NE_show-1 benefit , but there be no guarantee i will definitely get it .
although there be still paper to be publish after i return to my country , they 're quite useless for the application to the NE_show-0 .
-CONST--0 . a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 tier provincial university , professor , -CONST--1 - -CONST--2 yuan house subsidy and -CONST--3 yuan research grant .
i can work on my current research topic .
i can only be an advisor for the NE_program-0 's program . they do n't have doctoral programs as of today .
my husband suggest that -CONST--0 go to -CONST--1 because the start point be higher , the current pay be alright , and if -CONST--2 can n't make it there in future -CONST--3 can still go to -CONST--4 .
the university be in the suburb ; the school district be fairly ordinary , and there be not many choice in term of house .
later on , my teacher take me in his arm and i feel it very soft and very warm . after that , i get up and give my teacher a kiss on the forehead .
it be not only that . he also say the old bicycle be buy at a roadside yard sale by his retire friend , and not free of charge .
he just emailed that friend to ask him ENT_amr-unknown-0 it cost .

ENT_amr-unknown-0 must he go to a city with many NE_country-0 people ?
actually , so what if he go to NE_city-0 ? there be no superstar there , but this be exactly his chance .
moreover , he be not qualify to bargain with his owner when he have yet to prove his power on the NE_league-0 court .
on ENT_ordinal-entity-0 thought , he can absolutely play in another city when his rookie player contract end after -CONST--0 to -CONST--1 year .
NE_person-0 's team be obviously a notch better in term of attitude and way of deal with thing . i really do not wish for NE_person-1 's team to become the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 NE_person-2 .

on the other hand , the war have strengthen the position of the right and its NE_person-0 , and it help to bring NE_person-1 back to the ENT_government-organization-0 .
but the most critical review be the -CONST--0 by NE_person-0 in NE_newspaper-0 . he write : " did we win the war that broke out exactly -CONST--1 year ago , or be we defeat ?
not exactly .
but since NE_country-0 must win the confrontation with its enemy , the draw equal a defeat .
be our position today better than what it be -CONST--0 year ago on the eve of the war ?
be the position of NE_political-party-0 better today than it be -CONST--0 year ago ?
no , the party have be deal quite a major military blow , but from another point of view , it achieve an important moral victory .
it be true that it be push back off the border fence , but -CONST--0 be entrench and fortify -CONST--1 to the north of the NE_river-0 .
it withstand its confrontation with the NE_country-0 military might , but it lose many of its troop and lose the element of surprise .
NE_person-0 be in a real hole and NE_person-1 be in a virtual one , since -CONST--0 approval rate be almost equal to zero and the danger of the vinograd report be lurk on the horizon .
this be the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time that the big powerful NE_ethnic-group-0 state stand openly with NE_country-0 in its war on an NE_religious-group-0 - NE_ethnic-group-1 enemy .
the global struggle of civilization be happen here on our land before the eye of the world .
it be not for nothing that NE_continent-0 send the multinational force to south NE_country-0 , and the NE_country-1 be deploy all that they have leave to support the NE_person-0 ENT_government-organization-0 in NE_city-0 .
everyone know that NE_country-0 control over NE_country-1 and the imminent NE_country-2 departure from NE_country-3 will contribute to the downfall of NE_religious-group-0 in the NE_world-region-0 and the supremacy of the fundamentalist .
be the army rebuild its force ?

the court also find that NE_person-0 have be convict on charge of shoplift from store almost every year over a period of -CONST--0 year .
NE_person-0 say that rob the bank be much easier than sort out his affair and his retirement spend outside the prison .
the issue therefore do not concern some opinion that provoke wave of objection , but rather it fundamentally concern a vision of the role of the NE_organization-0 ideology , and its universal message .
so the begin deny the relationship between NE_religious-group-0 and reason , as though NE_religious-group-1 be a religion that be hostile to reason and there be no place for reason in the islamic faith .
the search for a war in which victory would be easy be in reality no more than an electoral campaign . this campaign can only succeed in elect or re - elect the neo - conservative as leader of the NE_country-0 . but it be a success whose price be to push the world toward destruction , fabricate crises that detract from the real challenge , and the absence of a compass and priority .

-CONST--0 NE_military-0 ally be prepare to sign a deal on -CONST--1 -CONST--2 -CONST--3 to create a research center in NE_city-0 , NE_country-0 to improve the NE_military-1 alliance 's defenses against cyber attack .
cyber attack be consider a grow threat to military and civilian computer network .
in -CONST--0 NE_country-0 experience an unprecedented number of cyber attack that disable ENT_government-organization-0 and corporate computer network .
the attack occur after a dispute between the ENT_government-organization-0 of NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 over the relocation of a NE_country-2 war memorial .
many NE_country-0 suspect the NE_country-1 ENT_government-organization-0 be responsible for the cyber attack but the ENT_government-organization-1 deny involvement .
defense chief from NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 , NE_country-3 , NE_country-4 , NE_country-5 and NE_country-6 will sign the agreement to provide staff and fund for the center .
the NE_country-0 will join the project as an observer and other NE_military-0 nation may join later .
sign of the agreement be a peripheral issue of the meet of chief of defense staff from the -CONST--0 ally country of NE_military-0 .
the meet be expect to focus on NE_military-0 mission in NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 .
the general will also discuss cooperation with NE_world-region-0 and former NE_country-0 nation include NE_country-1 and NE_country-2 .
the NE_facility-0 will be operational in -CONST--0 -CONST--1 with the formal open plan for -CONST--2 .

NE_company-0 announce today it will acquire ticket website NE_company-1 for -CONST--0 NE_country-0 dollar
eのsnail
accord to the international report on -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , NE_company-0 announce that it will acquire online ticket website NE_company-1 for -CONST--2 NE_country-0 dollar in cash to further expand its influence on electronic commerce .
the acquisition be expect to be complete before -CONST--0 .
more than -CONST--0 year ago , NE_person-0 and NE_school-0 NE_person-1 found NE_company-0 with fluhr as its chief executive officer .
NE_person-0 say in a statement : " NE_company-0 's business model be an excellent fit with NE_company-1 , and we have admire NE_company-2 for a long time . "
over the past -CONST--0 year , as investor be concern about the slowdown in NE_company-0 's online auction business , its poor management , slow business expansion , and other factor , its market value have be dwindle .
in succession NE_company-0 acquire internet phone service NE_company-1 and online price - comparison NE_company-2 .
NE_company-0 mainly operate ticket brokerage to major event .
in -CONST--0 its ticket sale be -CONST--1 NE_country-0 dollar with ENT_temporal-quantity-0 profit reach -CONST--2 NE_country-1 dollar .
ticket seller sell ticket on this website must pay a -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 fee , while buyer also have to pay a -CONST--1 ENT_percentage-entity-1 commission to NE_company-0 .
as of now , -CONST--0 ticket have be sell on the NE_company-0 website .
many discovery be make by chance .
NE_person-0
i remember my ENT_ordinal-entity-0 year study at NE_university-0 , i go to my ENT_ordinal-entity-1 elective course call " inspiration in the history of physic . "
there be only -CONST--0 or so of us who have choose it that semester .
the teacher be very erudite , his lecture be very lively ; he summarize all of the recent and contemporary history of physic , and each time i be enthral .
in all my -CONST--0 year at the university , i never have another course that interesting .
if i be to summarize this course , it would be : the greatest discovery in physic all have their own necessity and theoretical basis ( for example , the development of mathematics ) .
this theory can also be apply to cook .
one day i want to make green bean and bean curd sheet ( dry tofu in the NE_country-region-0 ) .
here the dry tofu sell in the store be all compress , very tough .
so i normally steep it in hot water , then take it out and stir - fry it .
because that day i need to go out in the middle of it and buy some thing , i set the timer and tell my wife to turn off the heat when it be do .
my wife be very lazy , and when the timer sound , she turn off the heat and leave the pot sit on the stove .
when i come back and look , the dried tofu be white and soft , just like freshly make .
chalk another good one up to the wife .
NE_person-0 's economic note : your uncle be just your uncle .
NE_person-0 's economic note
this morning i go to the supermarket with dad , and when it come time to check out i discover something that everybody probably know : not everybody buy the same thing .
of course this be a no - brainer , but this be actually a major problem face by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issue or economic phenomena .
most of the time , economic policy and economic theory be not aim at individual .
in term of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , use any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate be virtually -CONST--0 .
in fact , in the great majority of case the economic theory be aim at an entire group , or a subgroup .
in term of average , accuracy be the goal of many economic theory ( here i 'm be inaccurate ; i hope the expert will not take it too literally , especially those with io expertise ) .
but with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he see only his co @-@ worker , his relative and his friend , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number -CONST--0 , and that be already a lot of people .
below i be go to refer to these -CONST--0 people collectively as " his uncle . "
so whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : my uncle be n't like that , so this theory be baloney .
in other word , everybody tend to mistake the part for the whole .
here , mistake the part for the whole be not derogatory ; it be a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and i have it .
if NE_country-0 have learn not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have make such a mess of the world .
i believe that they make such a complete mess of the NE_world-region-0 to a very large extent because they apply their own common sense to understand the NE_world-region-1 .
on this issue , NE_country-0 do not have much basis for be self - congratulatory ; NE_country-1 's rapid rise have even cause some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever NE_country-2 do be right - and this be in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness .
therefore i believe it be extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge have limitation .
we need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward thing that do n't correspond to our common sense .
so just because every time your uncle go to the supermarket he buy hog head meat do n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that do not predict people go to the supermarket will buy hog head meat be wrong .
when you feel other people be talk baloney , and what other people say do not correspond to your " common sense , " you should at the same time recognize that your uncle be only your uncle , he be not the whole world .
well , gasoline in NE_city-0 have have hit $ 3.00 -CONST--0 gallon , or just shy of it ,
and i spend $ -CONST--0 fill up the gas tank of my NE_car-make-0 --
the most i 've ever pay for in my life .
i 'm not happy about it ,
but i do n't see high gas price as a reason to start foam at the mouth and chew on the carpet .
others feel less constrain .
the hysteria over rise gas price have reach a fever pitch .
the economic ignorance of the sound bite and commentary i 've see on national television know no bound .
demagogue be call for self - destructive tax on oil company profit , oblivious to the reality that , in a capitalist society , profit be a critical signal that guide the flow of capital .
( 1 ) if you confiscate NE_company-0 's profit , you reduce the capital available to the world 's largest oil company to invest in more exploratory drill , new oil well , new pipeline , new refinery , etc.
( 2 ) if you tax oil industry profit , you also reduce the incentive for owner of outside capital to invest in new capacity .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 bother if the profit will be tax away ?
here in NE_state-0 , a semblance of sanity still reign .
gov. NE_person-0 have not yet propose anything as breath - takingly stupid as the proposal emanating from NE_city-0 .
the governor have say he will investigate report of `` price gouge , '' which , give the fact that the the concept of `` price gouge '' be meaningless and impossible to define , mean he will , for all practical purpose , do nothing ....
which be exactly what he should do .
nothing .
NE_state-0 and NE_country-0 will adapt to higher gas price if ENT_government-organization-0 do not interfere .
( the governor also be consider apply for a waiver of federal regulation require cleaner gasoline be sell in NE_state-0 's major metro area , but have not yet make a determination .
see the NE_newspaper-0 report .
unfortunately , he 's stick to his gun on try to raise $ -CONST--0 for transportation project without raise gasoline tax -- a topic for another post .
as i have be hammer away relentlessly on this blog ( see `` a world with -CONST--0 car '' ) , the world economy be move from a -CONST--1 - year era of cheap petroleum to a plateau of more expensive petroleum .
this shift be drive by the combination of ( a ) escalate world consumption of petroleum , especially in rapidly develop economy like NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 , and ( b ) the peak of global oil production capacity , the increase expense of exploit the remote and isolate oil reserve that remain , and terrorist / political instability in oil - produce country .
this be not the oil company ' fault .
this be not NE_person-0 's fault .
this be not the auto industry ' fault .
it be not the environmentalist ' fault .
it 's the reality of geology and geopolitics .
the NE_country-0 public can adapt to the new global reality by change their energy - intensive lifestyles ,
and politician can help them by speak honestly and forthrightly about ENT_amr-unknown-0 the price of gasoline be increase , instead of demagoguing the issue for short - term political gain .
here in NE_state-0 , the NE_government-organization-0 have be examine what NE_state-1 can do to increase energy production .
that be ok , as far as it go .
but there be nothing that NE_state-0 can do to increase the global supply of oil , and probably little it can do to increase the petroleum refine capacity need to convert oil to gasoline .
what the political and business leadership of NE_state-0 have so far fail utterly to do be admit that NE_state-1 be acutely vulnerable to oil price shock .
NE_state-0 consume more gasoline per capita than the national average , in part because our transportation policy be gear toward matching every increase in automobile travel with an increase in transportation capacity with no thought of modulate travel demand .
but reality be a stubborn thing .
with each increase in the price of gasoline , the bankruptcy of the old order become increasingly evident .
let us hope that gov. NE_person-0 himself on straight talk , begin leveling with the people of NE_state-0 .
NE_person-0 be right on the money about how capitalism work ,
so ENT_amr-unknown-0 not try to make capitalism really work for NE_state-0 .
the future in transportation belong to the nation , company or person who develop the alternative to gasoline power automobile .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 not do everything we can to assure that future arise from NE_state-0 ?
rather than drill for oil and gas off the NE_country-region-0 , we should be offer enormous incentive for comapnies and individual who want to work on alternative fuel solution to locate their business here .
you can encourage r&d on alternative fuel with grant and tax break .
and , you can work to increase supply .
the one and only oil refinery in the NE_organization-0 be nearby in NE_city-0 .
they could double their capacity without leave the premise .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 have n't the company apply to do builf new facility on site ?
by all mean explore for oil and gas in the NE_ocean-0 .
NE_person-0 : speak seriously here , many family ( include my own ) have already cut back in every way possible .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 then ?
my office , home and children 's school be all within a -CONST--0 mile radius .
vacation be already a thing of the past .
we 've cut back on grocery .
i 'd trade the car on a hybrid ,
but it 's pay for
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 can afford a car payment what with mortgage rate be ENT_amr-unknown-1 they be and -CONST--0 kid ...
so , i ask seriously , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be average hard - work family to do ?
NE_person-0 : ENT_amr-unknown-0 about a couple of -CONST--0 dollar ?
if the NE_government-organization-0 repeal the unnecessary sale tax from last year , then the average citizen would pick up some cash .
or , the NE_government-organization-0 could actually cut the sale tax
and you would keep some more of your money .
check out ENT_amr-unknown-0 the NE_political-party-0 senator want you to pay in other , new tax too - to register your car , etc.
NE_person-0 : i like the graphic ,
it take -CONST--0 arm and -CONST--1 leg to fill up our tank .
the only answer to cut the cost of mobility and access be settlement pattern that require less vehicle travel and support more effecient share - vehicle when one must resort to any vehicle .
that be what an understand of NE_person-0 suggest -CONST--0 year ago ( not just in `` NE_book-0 ... but also `` NE_book-1 ' . ''
let us , honor NE_person-0 's memory with an understand of the need for fundamental change .
NE_person-0
NE_person-0 - got ta love it .
yup , a couple of -CONST--0 dollar be go to save the day !
NE_person-0 know the difference between a community and a construction plan .
was n't one of her main argument that you can not plan everything , and you should allow community to be what they be and what they become ?
did n't she fight NE_person-0 because he think he have too much control over other people ' life ?
somehow i doubt she would have get on board with fundamental change if it involve massive central and regional plan .
NE_person-0 , -CONST--0 option may be telecommuting a couple of day -CONST--1 week .
other than that , here 's the hard truth :
there 's not much that average , hard - work family can do in the short run to cope with higher gas price except hope that their paychecks keep pace with inflation .
what you should not do be support demagogic political ploy that make problem worse , not better .
in the long run , you can support more pedestrian friendly , transit - friendly development pattern that give you and your family more transportation option .
you should support development pattern that allow compatible use ( house , small office building , small retail shop ) to be locate close to each rather than scatter all over .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 money could you save if you could get by with only -CONST--0 car instead of -CONST--1 ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 would it mean if you live in a place where your children could walk to school ?
think outside the box .
NE_person-0 , i 'm all in favor of alternate fuel .
convert biomass to ethanol seem to be one that be self - sustain economically without massive incentive .
i 'd favor ENT_government-organization-0 - sponsor research to devise technology that would make ethanol more competitive ,
but i do n't like the idea of subsidize specific business enterprise .
once you give them a subsidy , they never let go , no matter ENT_amr-unknown-0 the world change around them .
witness the mohair subsidy put into place during NE_war-0 .
i tend to agree with NE_person-0 that market function best , so long as no one have a finger on the scale .
many believe that zone price , which be generally use by oil company , be inconsistent with our antitrust law ( section -CONST--0 of the NE_law-0 ) .
others disagree .
do zone price constitute a finger on the scale ?
if so , should the NE_government-organization-0 outlaw zone price ?
NE_person-0 : zone price be the mechanism the oil company use to make sure that we pay the same price as people in state with higher gas tax .
only , we pay the extra few cent per gallon to them rather than into our state transportation account .
consider the wide variety in local and state fuel tax the near uniformity of the pump price across state line be ... curious .
i be recently on the webpage for the NE_government-organization-0
and their cost of fuel adjust for inflation chart demonstates that we have be at $ -CONST--0 per gallon measure in -CONST--1 dollar before .
it be about the historic peak in real price ,
but it be hardly unprecedented , and not worth quite the hype or hysteria it be generate .
it be hard to imagine a company or a family that can not improve its efficiency and reduce consumption ,
and that be not a bad outcome at all .
like -CONST--0 , NE_person-0 , i see the bright silver line .
i seem to be get more question whenever i pull up in my hybrid .
-CONST--0 data point .
-CONST--0 @:@ -CONST--1 ENT_amr-unknown-0 be gas price often significantly different for the same brand between NE_county-0 and NE_county-1 and even at different location within the same county ?
zone price be try to do much more than reflect different tax rate .
take a look at the following link : -CONST--0 : //www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx
assume the general accuracy of the data underlie the map ,
difference in do not explain zone price .
look at NE_state-0 , for example .
there be much higher transportation cost in and around the NE_canyon-0 and much more competition in the NE_city-0 market .
yet , NE_city-0 price tend to be signficantly higher .
ditto for tax .
from what i quickly find on the internet , total fuel tax for the follow -CONST--0 state be NE_state-0 ( -CONST--1 cent ) ; NE_state-1 ( -CONST--2 cent ) ; NE_state-2 ( -CONST--3 cent ) and NE_state-3 ( -CONST--4 cent ) .
however , both NE_state-0 and NE_state-1 have average price that be significantly lower than either NE_state-2 or NE_state-3 .
there 's probably less relationship to cost and zone price than the oil company want the public to believe .
i have a conversation with a friend the other day who own an suv
and he be n't worry about the price of gas because he travel less than -CONST--0 mile a day ..
yes ..
it 'll cost more ...
so he 'll have to cut back on his gourmet coffee ... -CONST--0 cup rather than -CONST--1 . :-)
seriously - it 's about ENT_amr-unknown-0 far folk choose to drive and ENT_amr-unknown-1 folk define phrase like `` i must and have no choice '' .
it take a hard knock for folk to take a hard look at thing they always assume could not change .
i predict ... lot of folk will be take harder look at whether or not choice be choice or no choice '' be truly no choice .
i know it happen during the gas crisis ...
and as bad as it be now - this be not as bad as then - though if $ -CONST--0 a gallon be in the rear view mirror and $ -CONST--1 a gallon on the horizon and come fast ... we might think so ...
.. but i would bet that folk would choose ( there 's that word again ) $ -CONST--0 or even $ -CONST--1 a gallon rather than wait in line for -CONST--2 hour only to find out the guy in front of you get the last tankful .
NE_country-0 's love affair with the automobile be about to be revisted though i doubt seriously a divorce be anywhere near ... :-)
sorry .. my attitude be grin and bear it ...
it 's sort of like coffee double in price ...
my property accessment go up -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 ( which it do ) ...
... and today .. i pay $ -CONST--0 buck to fill up my 89 NE_car-make-0 van .
i get ta talk to NE_person-0 about that hybrid .... he 's get ..
he say if he have to choose .. he 'd keep his truck ... :-)
did i really say that ?
that would be a tough `` choice '' .
with the truck i 'd have some chance of make money ,
but i 'd hate to have to drive it if it be n't work .
if you have to drive , the hybrid be a joy .
dead silent , dirt cheap , reliable , little bit of capital cost detriment , sufficient power .
-CONST--0 mpg if you drive at 75+ like a maniac .
i remember people sniff at it , say they would n't do it because the payback on capital be n't there .
i drone on about cost and benefit , but a ) that 's not everything , and b ) sometimes circumstance change .
i 'm go to have to send a letter to the guv'nor .
i have a bunch of vehicle and only use the appropriate one for the task at hand .
i need a portable license plate and insurance , otherwise the current `` tax '' plan be go to kill me .
i sure hope that those of you who think save open space and farm will chip in and help out on this :
send a letter .
i do n't mind pay what it cost to drive or pay what i owe ,
but this be go to be whack .
i suspect that overhead cost might have something to do with fuel price .
that gas station in NE_city-0 be sit on expensive land and pay high tax .
business be `` tax positive '' do n't cha know .
if people really do start make different choice , it 's go to be fun to watch real estate price .
btw -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 more new home sale last year , in spite of higher rate ,
but price be down 5k .
time to demand another reassessment .
NE_person-0 : tax be indeed business overhead that affect retail price .
but i still suggest that zone price have more to do with computer software and data - mine than actual cost .

if you 're NE_county-0 , you create a new vision for the boxy building and subterranean passageway in NE_city-0 that will be empty by the federal NE_government-organization-0 .
in place of the sterile monoculture that now characterize the office complex near the NE_government-organization-0 , member of an advisory task force see a more lively street - level scene with a greater mix of shop , restaurant and office .
write wapo reporter NE_person-0 :
[ NE_government-organization-0 chairman NE_person-0 and others speak yesterday say that the vounty see the empty space as an opportunity to `` reimagine '' and `` brand '' NE_city-0 as an attractive destination .
though close to NE_airport-0 and dense with hotel , the area have long be see as a gloomy -CONST--0 s era enclave of office connect by underground passage .
but part of NE_city-0 have lately see a rebirth , thank to an influx of trendy cafe and a new streetscape ....
NE_company-0 -CONST--0 of the -CONST--1 square feet of office space in the neighborhood , have spend $ -CONST--2 on improvement to enliven the street and attract new business .
it turn NE_road-0 into a two - way main street and have recruit new shop and chic restaurant such as NE_restaurant-0 and NE_restaurant-1 .
read between the line of NE_person-0 's story , however , there seem to be one big miss piece :
house .
create a livelier commercial district be a worthy goal .
but create a balanced community with a mix of house , office , shop and other amenity -- allow people to live close to where they work and play -- be an even more worthy goal .
as NE_person-0 have point out , the relocation of -CONST--0 job create a rare opportunity to create a genuine balance community in NE_local-region-0 .
the problem , i surmise -- it 's not discuss in the story -- be that NE_county-0 be concern about protect -CONST--0 tax base , which mean replace the vacated office with new office , not house .
it 's hard to fault NE_county-0 for pursue its short - term self interest .
but everyone need to recognize that NE_county-0 's decision not to pursue a balanced community mean that house will end up somewhere else , presumably in outlying county .
and employee work in the buff up NE_city-0 will wind up commute long distance and clog NE_country-region-0 thoroughfare .
so i work in that same beauty salon ,
i 'm chain to the old masquerade
the lipstick , the shadow , the silicone :
i follow my father 's trade -
NE_person-0
NE_person-0 may be another example of a celebrity distraction which , upon examination , reveal more about our society 's mortal condition than a tabloid could imagine .
almost certainly more than it would dare to describe .
yesterday , NE_person-0 be order to close NE_facility-0 for have fail to pay the ranch 's -CONST--0 employee -CONST--1 salary or insurance since the end of -CONST--2 .
unfortunate for the unpaid staff and the abandon llama but no surprise .
he 's move on since his aquittal , like NE_person-0 do after his -CONST--0 conviction , have depart last -CONST--1 for a NE_country-0 `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
( '' for the people work at NE_country-0 's mall , the person cover head to toe in a black veil , glove and glass appear to be a rich , doting NE_country-1 mother ....
but ENT_amr-unknown-0 would a woman wear a man 's shoe ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 the bodyguard ?
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 do the person 's fluid movement seem so familiar ? '' )
last week 's real NE_person-0 story run in the NE_newspaper-0 , under the snappy banner `` creepy dad be root of all clan 's woe , singer sez . ''
the singer be brother NE_person-0 , and the claim based on the project outline for his abandon `` tell - all '' family story .
read that NE_person-0 be a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards his daughter be not exactly a `` stop the press '' moment .
what 's new be this :
NE_person-0 even suggest his father may have set up NE_person-1 to be somehow victimize by older men .
he tell how his father would have NE_person-0 join in at late - night hotel room meeting with `` important business people , '' and wonder whether `` something happen '' to NE_person-1 at those session .
he say he sense something be wrong because NE_person-0 would be sick for day after .
`` ENT_amr-unknown-0 be NE_person-0 do ? '' NE_person-1 write .
this lift the NE_family-0 horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that see parent network with power and trade their children for privilege .
this should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivor : the father and ENT_ordinal-entity-0 controller , pass his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward .
or maybe not : `` NE_person-0 also describe be awaken in the night by NE_person-1 wear a ' monster mask . ' ''
perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the NE_clan-0 have get with the program .
perhaps rather the point be that the program exploit pre @-@ exist condition for abuse which be more common than most suspect .
( this be how i tend to think of NE_city-0 's NE_worship-place-0 . )
yet we should n't discount the suspicion , either , particularly give some of NE_person-0 's paranormal interest and peculiar association .
his close friendship with NE_organization-0 contactee and channeller of NE_organization-1 , NE_person-0 , for one instance .
( NE_person-0 be NE_person-1 's best man in -CONST--0 when he and his wife renew his vow , the same year NE_person-2 be say to have be reactivate as a psychic spy . )
his entourage include a `` personal magician '' for another .
even if you want to , you wo n't be read NE_person-0 's account now .
like every NE_person-0 sibling who 's try to break from NE_person-1 , he 's climb down , return to the fold and scrap the book , apparently on the strength of NE_person-2 's threat to sue .
previously , NE_person-0 's give cause for family observer to attribute his grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resemble his father .
yet there they be at NE_person-0 's trial last year , hand in hand .
but his little picture may be more newsworthy than the news suggest .
good stuff .
have depart last -CONST--0 for a NE_country-0 `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
actually , there have be report for the past -CONST--0 day of NE_person-0 back in NE_state-0 .
#name ?
wild wild stuff NE_person-0 !
disinformation distraction dis and dat ..
bait and switch set the agenda .
there be no such thing as an accident .
it 's saturday morning , and the paper say a moon of NE_planet-0 be spew life - give water .... then i see the new NE_publication-0 post be about the perrenial NE_child-0 .
this day be name for NE_planet-0 ...
" ... it be foretell that one day a mighty son of NE_planet-0 would in turn overthrow him ,
and NE_planet-0 devour all of his children when they be born to prevent this ... ''
apparently NE_planet-0 be also intimately connect with NE_person-0 , masonic , and NE_publication-0 - you know , the `` number of the beast '' ...
nevermind -
-CONST--0 need -CONST--1 cup of coffee ...
i look in vain for the NE_person-0 `` a hunt we will go '' to post this out and paste but ...
and on the subject of cowardice , consider this . in a recent hunt escapade , NE_person-0 accidentally shoot one of his hunt comrade .
there may have be negligence involve , but that be up to the local district attorney to decide .
but more importantly , i think , be the nature of the hunt .
these be not wild bird .
the bird be breed in captivity .
they have spend their life in pen , and then on hunt day , be release for the sole purpose of be kill by NE_person-0 and cohort for pure sport as they fly into the open sky for their only moment of brief freedom .
the link `` personal majician '' be intrigueing .
from NE_person-0 via NE_person-1 :
NE_person-0 's stay at the NE_facility-0 be arrange through NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 's NE_facility-1 director NE_government-organization-0 .
NE_person-0 also previously work for the NE_religious-group-0 and senator NE_person-1 .
there 's also some curious NE_facility-0 / NE_amusement-park-0 connection to the `` NE_broadcast-program-0 '' children who be now star , include NE_person-0 ( remember the star on NE_person-1 's breast ? ) and brittany NE_person-2 , NE_person-3 ...
the piper walk into the mountain , still follow by the children , and the cave close again ...
here be NE_person-0 's follow up to the `` majician '' link of NE_person-1 's .
but i think you might cover NE_country-0 's inauguration of its ENT_ordinal-entity-0 woman president today instead ...
maybe later as the story develop ?
NE_person-0 's piece mention how victim of sexual abuse often have childlike voice , almost as if their development be ' freeze ' around the time of their abuse .
NE_person-0 seem to be of this type .
or more perversely , fake that he be :
`` i be always say [ to NE_person-0 ] people would n't think i be so crazy if they see who the hell you really be , that you sit around , and -CONST--0 drink and -CONST--1 curse and you 're [ expletive ] funny and you have a bad mouth , and you do n't have that high voice all the time '' -
NE_person-0 , in an interview quote in a NE_newspaper-0 article write by NE_person-1 :
NE_person-0 's false front ?
`` NE_person-0 , be go !
NE_person-0 , be go ! ''
the witch doctor curse NE_person-0 's enemy and bless the tarnished king of pop himself in a voodoo ritual in NE_country-0 in the summer of -CONST--0 have promise that the -CONST--1 people on jackson 's enemy list ( would soon be dead ) ...
NE_person-0 have order NE_person-1 , to wire $ -CONST--0 to a bank in NE_country-0 for a voodoo chief name NE_person-2 , who then have -CONST--1 cow ritually sacrifice for the ceremony .
NE_person-0 have already undergo a blood bath ...
the pop star , who be say to be $ -CONST--0 in debt , have pay -CONST--1 figure for a ritual cleanse use sheep blood to another voodoo doctor and a mysterious NE_country-0 woman name NE_woman-0 , who come to him with a letter of greet from a high - rank saudi prince , purportedly NE_person-0 , now the chief of intelligence of NE_country-1 ...

accord to that NE_magazine-0 article , NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 meet through `` that other fellow devotee of children 's charity NE_person-2 , the chairman of NE_company-0 in NE_city-0 , who believe that the c.i.a. and NE_person-3 have NE_person-4 and his son , NE_person-5 , kill . ''
anonymous quote , `` NE_person-0 's stay at the NE_facility-0 be arrange through NE_person-1 ... ''
hold on --
the NE_facility-0 be the headquarters of the NE_organization-0 , the creepy christianoid cult with deep political connection .
here 's a bit of the original NE_person-0 article that the NE_person-1 quote come from :
in -CONST--0 , the NE_organization-0 begin look for a permanent headquarters in NE_city-0 .
it set its sight on the estate of NE_person-0 , NE_estate-0 , locate at -CONST--0 NE_street-0 .
NE_person-0 be one of the drafters of the NE_law-0 .
the NE_organization-0 , also know as the -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , buy the property from NE_person-0 .
although not much be know about NE_person-0 , the NE_newspaper-0 report that NE_man-0 with whom NE_organization-0 senator NE_person-1 once spar , also live there .
accord to a senior NE_government-organization-0 official , the NE_estate-0 have be use as a NE_government-organization-1 safe house prior to the NE_organization-0 's purchase of the NE_estate-1 .

NE_person-0 of NE_company-0 be another deep - pocket supporter of the NE_organization-0 through NE_activity-06-0 link to fellowship core member NE_person-1 .
suffer the little children , eh ?
if this be what power & wealth do to you , i 'm damn glad i have neither .
you say , `` perhaps rather the point be that the program exploit pre @-@ exist condition for abuse which be more common than most suspect . ''
could n't agree more .
i think that pedophilia 's relative commonality be what really make it frighten .
my experience happen when i be -CONST--0 .
a friend of mine met this guy who be -CONST--0 our age & who be more than willing to buy -CONST--1 all the whiskey we could drink .
we be both enamored with NE_person-0 & NE_person-1 & meet strange character & this guy definitely fit the bill .
he be muscle for a NE_city-0 madam name NE_madam-0 .
she dress like a man & run most of the massage parlors in NE_city-0 .
he be into black magick & NE_person-0 & booze & drug & on & on .
& my buddy pass out .
i continue drink .
at one point , i glance at this older guy ,
& he be stare at my buddy as a line of drool run down the cigarette in his mouth & drip on to the floor .
he notice that i 'm kind of stare at him .
he stand up , walk into the bedroom , & come back with a porno mag .
he drop it on the couch next to me .
as he 's sit down , he say , `` see anything you like ? ''
& then he shove his hand hard into my groin .....
.... & i break his nose with my elbow .
i apologize for continue my ramble but ... ,
NE_person-0
manchild in a promise land
by NE_person-0
he 's such an easy NE_person-0 .
he make even the weirdest of the weird feel normal .
but unlike them , NE_person-0 do n't try to hide the fact that he be easily one of the most screw up being on the planet .
every time he check in for yet another surgery , he be announce to the world that he do n't know who he be , where he be go , and that he thoroughly loathe himself - at least the adult version .
and for -CONST--0 remarkable honesty , his most unprivate confession , he be subject to one public humiliation after another .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 among us rock thrower would have the courage to reveal about ourselves ENT_amr-unknown-1 NE_person-0 have reveal about himself ?
next to the tower monument that the unedited NE_person-0 be we be telephone booth ;
next to his singular guilelessness and candor , we be the multitude of the prevaricate and pusillanimous .
everything NE_person-0 have do and say during the past -CONST--0 year have be against his own apparent self - interest , begin with unrelenting surgical assault on his erstwhile good look , to hang his child ( and crotch for that matter ) out to dry , to enter detail of his bedroom antics into the public domain .
like a typical dostoievksy character , we can not account for the behavior if it be n't for an apparently override need to confess and proclaim -- over and against what the outside world want to believe -- the truth of who we be .
the on - go spectacle of NE_person-0 's increasingly bizarre conduct be his confession to the world that he be one spectacularly psychologically - challenged dude .
like children who be incapable of dissimulate their basic want and need , NE_person-0 's manner of be in the world be uncensored and spontaneous ,
and to such an unsuspected extent i propose he deserve to be consider -CONST--0 of the most authentic being of this or any other century , and quite properly belong to that exceptional society of authenticity - questers that would include NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 and NE_person-2 .
the fact of NE_person-0 's life have be well document .
we know that by the age of -CONST--0 he be on top of the world .
NE_music-0 have sell an unprecedented -CONST--0 copy and NE_music-1 have become the musical drug of choice in every corner of the world .
not only be the song 's momentum and tension brilliantly craft and fuse , NE_person-0 's rivet , counterpoint choreography - which remain unsurpassed -- revolutionized the way we simultaneously look at and listen to music .
before disbelieve eye , his torso , head and limb supply never - before - see anatomical rejoinder to the note -- like a guitarist fill in between the lyric .
but from here on in , it would be downhill for the genre 's quintessential messenger , for NE_person-0 could no long sustain the ' great lie ' he be live .
the child 's ' tin drum ' be beat ever louder in his head
and he intuitively understand that he be developmentally under - equip to handle the adult pressure of stardom .
far more compel than the promise of even greater fame and fortune be the example of NE_person-0 , from gunther NE_person-1 ' NE_book-0 ( -CONST--0 ) , which tell the story of a boy who refuse to grow up , who , through his drum , reject the adult world and the horror take place in NE_country-0 .
like NE_person-0 , NE_person-1 have witness firsthand the abomination of adult behaviour and refuse to sign up .
from his early year , NE_person-0 be subject to both extreme psychological and physical abuse at the hand of his status - obsess father , who designate michael as the vessel into which he would mercilessly pour the acid of his unrealized ambition .
to this single end , NE_person-0 be ruthlessly single - minded .
NE_person-0 be terrify of him , whose mere presence could induce nausea .
at the age of -CONST--0 , the father yank the son from his pail and sandbox existence and make him run NE_city-district-0 's grimmest gauntlet .
the little mouse that NE_person-0 be suddenly find himself in the rat race and quickly learn to hate it ,
and like NE_person-0 respite in the beat of his tin drum , NE_person-1 find solace on stage , perform his music .
but the stage could not provide NE_person-0 with immunity against the constant encroachment of the adult world .
listen to his rapid breathe in especially NE_music-0 and NE_music-1 : the staccato - like pant of a stalk animal , the desperate breath of human panic , and his small boy 's voice hide behind the mesmerize slash and blur of arm and leg fending off an invisible attack .
from one track to the next , the lyric be n't so much sung as frantically whisper , the vowel cut short to the quick .
NE_person-0 be announce that he could no longer follow the course father and NE_city-district-0 have stake out for him , that the disparity between his real self and the role he be thrust into have reach unsustainable incommensurability .
only the child within could save the defenceless adult from the depredation of the adult world ,
and from this point on , NE_person-0 would reduce the project of his life to let the world know the truth of who he be : a confused , fragile , lose soul in search of care and love .
by the ENT_temporal-quantity-0 NE_person-0 have attain mythic status , he be so far remove and alienate from himself , he would have to shed , over a period of -CONST--0 year and still count , one skin after another before his true self could begin to emerge .
as we might expect from someone so radically self - estrange , the result have be nothing less than a metamorphosis .
NE_person-0 's journey of self - discovery be a work in progress like no other because it increasingly depends on the accommodation of -CONST--0 irreconcilables : the child and adult as one .
more reveal of itself than its favorite target , public opinion have not see fit to grant NE_person-0 the inalienable right to -CONST--0 confused mental state and ' off the wall ' comportment .
if most people subscribe to the notion that black and white be not only skin colors but state of mind , why be we baffle or offend when NE_person-0 , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be introduce to the white way of NE_city-district-0 at the age of -CONST--0 , tell us that he be n't sure ENT_amr-unknown-1 his true color be ?
rob of his childhood , abuse by a psychotic father and then prematurely subject to the adult pressure of the entertainment world , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be we surprise to learn that NE_person-0 do n't want to grow up , that he prefer the company and community of children , that he want to be protect and look after ?
every time the androgynous NE_person-0 go under the knife he be cry out that he do n't know if he be man or woman , child or adult , black or white .
as if we would have do otherwise in his situation ?
and to the never - end suspicion that NE_person-0 be a child abuser , ENT_amr-unknown-0 crime have be commit when -CONST--0 experiment -CONST--1 - year - olds fool around sexually ?
if you believe that NE_person-0 have the mentality of an -CONST--0 - year - old , ( and there have n't be much evidence to the contrary during the past -CONST--1 year ) he should not have have to defend himself against accusation of child molestation .
was it in defense of perversity or his incorrigible innocence that convince him that it be ok to reveal that he share his bed with children ?
more questionable , even criminal , than NE_person-0 's alleged fool around with other kid , be the parent who allow , even encourage their children to sleep over and perhaps share the same bed with someone whose sexual predilection have be suspect since -CONST--0 .
on -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , -CONST--2 , the court find NE_person-0 not guilty of the charge bring against him .
however , those whose mind be decide on his guilt before the trial begin will not be change by the verdict , just as NE_person-0 's essential nature will not have change .
NE_person-0 write that ' there be a higher court than court of justice and that be the court of conscience . '
only NE_person-0 know if he be sexually attract to children , and beyond that , if he have ever act on those feeling .
and if we grant him the mental age of an -CONST--0 - year - old , who have nonetheless conventionally father -CONST--1 children , NE_person-0 be then a child trap in an adult body .
which mean the crown act in his quest for authenticity await -CONST--0 final operation .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do a man do ENT_amr-unknown-1 he feel , act and respond like a woman trap in a man 's body ?
he undergo sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy in order to become who ' she ' be .
there remain -CONST--0 final procedure that will totally liberate the child that NE_person-0 be .
when NE_person-0 find the courage to act on what his duty toward other children demand -- submit to voluntary neuter -- which will be tantamount to his final confession , the save grace and glory that be his NE_facility-0 will become his forever land .
NE_person-0 have say for all time , `` there 's not enough kindness in the world . ''
and i say this to you , NE_person-0 , may -CONST--0 tribe increase .
`` thank NE_person-0 i 'm an atheist : ''
the surrealistic cinema of NE_person-0 --
by NE_person-0
`` the thought of death have be familiar to me for a long time , '' say director NE_person-0 .
`` from the time that skeleton be carry through the street of NE_city-0 during the NE_event-0 procession , death have be an integral part of my life .
i 've never wish to forget or deny it ,
but there 's not much to say about it when you 're an atheist '' ( -CONST--0 ) .
so read an accurate testimonial to the personal and artistic sentiment of this odd and serious filmmaker .
like many of -CONST--0 contemporary surrealist , NE_person-0 be a paradox who on one hand claim apathy towards ultimate end , be , and be , yet on the other hand load his impressive body of work with moribund imagery and strange idea about the NE_person-1 he so vociferously deny .
NE_person-0 exhibit a radical , iconoclastic view of the world in which he find society decadent and antithetical to human liberation .
he have be call a realist , a surrealist , a marxist , an anarchist , a mystic , an anticleric , a freudian , a post @-@ freudian , a sadist , a moralist , a NE_religious-group-0 , and a poet - showman of the macabre .
his scenario range from the absurd to the tragic to the satiric to the erotic , profusely endue with the outrageous and the scandalous .
NE_person-0 have long be recognize in NE_continent-0 critical circle as a great and prolific filmmaker on a par with NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 , and NE_person-3 .
however , only recently have his reputation in NE_country-0 begun to catch up .
over his -CONST--0 - year career he direct -CONST--1 feature film and work in NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , NE_country-2 , NE_country-3 , and the NE_country-4 .
utilize sardonic humor and the imagery of surrealism , NE_person-0 set out to undermine the value and institution people take for grant .
his aim be specific : through the surreal , visualize the impulse of the uncon - scious , he would , he say , `` shatter the optimism of the bourgeoisie world and force the reader ( or spectator ) to question the permanency of the prevail ENT_ordinal-entity-0 '' ( NE_publication-0 -CONST--0 ) .
NE_person-0 be born -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , -CONST--2 in NE_city-0 , a small town in the NE_province-0 , NE_country-0 .
as a youth he receive a NE_religious-group-0 education , display exceptional talent in music , athletics , and the natural science .
he enjoy a comfortable upbringing in a reasonably wealthy , close - knit family .
his family come from liberal , semi @-@ intellectual , land - own bourgeoisie .
these detail be not irrelevant .
to comprehend NE_person-0 's work it be essential to understand that he be first a spaniard and secondly a product of NE_country-0 bourgeoisie .
NE_person-0 higgenbotham point out that `` blasphemy be only a form of think for any intelligent spaniard , '' and also that the `` art of his country be rich in eroticism and profoundly preoccupy with death '' ( -CONST--0 , -CONST--1 ) .
NE_person-0 say : my infancy slip by in an almost medieval atmosphere ( like that of nearly all the NE_country-0 province ) between my native town and zaragova .
i feel it necessary to say here ( since it explain in part the trend of the modest work which i late accomplish ) that the -CONST--0 basic sentiment of my childhood which stay with me well into adolescence , be those of a profound eroticism , at first sublimate in a great religious faith , and a permanent consciousness of death .
it would take too long here to analyze the reason .
it suffice that i be not an exception among my compatriot , since this be a very NE_country-0 characteristic , and our art , exponent of the NE_country-1 spirit , be impregnate with these -CONST--0 sentiment .
the last civil war , peculiar and ferocious as no other expose them clearly .
come of age , NE_person-0 express a strong urge to go to NE_city-0 to study music but be send instead to NE_city-1 to study agricultural engineer .
after a few year , he switch his study to entomology , and , more importantly , begin form close friendship with a group of young artist who be to influence him strongly in the future .
these companion include the NE_poet-0 and NE_poet-1 and the NE_person-0 .
in the NE_city-0 residencia NE_person-0 develop his interest in the art , theater , and act and gain his introduction to surrealism .
after graduate in -CONST--0 with a degree in philosophy and letter , NE_person-0 move to NE_city-0 , join by a few member of his residencia coterie .
NE_person-0 arrive in NE_city-0 highly recommend by influential friend of his parent and be introduce into the best intellectual circle of the city .
he be soon hire as an assistant director to NE_person-0 epstien , `` the only director of that bleak era of the NE_country-0 cinema to merit the title of an intellectual filmmaker '' ( NE_publication-0 -CONST--0 ) .
while hone his skill work as an a.d. , NE_person-0 also begin contribute article to various literary cinema periodical , most NE_publication-0 .
in -CONST--0 he formally enter the NE_organization-0 .
within this set he embark on his ENT_ordinal-entity-0 film project as director , a collaboration with his residencia friend NE_person-0 , entitle NE_work-of-art-0 .
he collaborate with NE_person-0 again in -CONST--0 on another surrealist NE_film-0 , l_age d ' or .
the rest , as they say , be history .
some critic , most notably NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 , now regard NE_person-2 as the NE_person-3 of surrealism -- a venerated master in total command of his medium and for whom the art of filmic manipulation become a `` delightful form of play . ''
for NE_person-0 , however , play have little to do with it .
rather , he see surrealism as a revolutionary , poetic , and moral movement :
all of us be supporter of a certain concept of revolution , and although the surrealist do n't consider themselves terrorist , they be constantly fight a society -CONST--0 despise .
the principle weapon be not gun , of course , it be scandal .
scandal be a potent agent of revelation , capable of expose such social crime as exploitation of one man by another , colonialist imperialism , religious tyranny -- in sum , all the secret and odious underpinnings of a system that have to be destroy .
he go on to say , `` the purpose of surrealism be not to create a new literary , artistic , or even philosophical movement , but to explode the social ENT_ordinal-entity-0 , to transform life itself ' ( -CONST--0 ) .
NE_person-0 recall the surrealist ' ideology , `` it be possible to systematize confusion thank to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discredit completely the world of reality '' ( NE_publication-0 -CONST--0 ) .
indeed , the intent of surreal art be to move one from the conscious mind into the subconscious .
it seek to affect the emotion through the mind .
NE_person-0 state in NE_book-0 , `` if the vision reveal be too much for the rational mind to absorb ( too intense , too threaten , too ' real ' ) yet can not be reject , then it leave the consciousness and come to exist on a sublime level as pure surrealism '' ( -CONST--0 ) .
in NE_product-0 , for example , a girl 's eye be slice with a razor blade ,
a man wipe his mouth completely off his face ,
dead donkey carcass adorn a piano ,
a man 's hand crawl with ant .
each of these image be clearly too intense for rational thought .
NE_person-0 be draw to the surrealist movement for more than revolutionary or psychological reason .
the moral aspect of the movement intrigue him as well :
for the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time in my life , i 'd come into contact with a coherent moral system that , as far as i could tell , have no flaw .
it be an aggressive morality based on the complete rejection of all exist value .
we have other criteria :
we exalt passion , mystification , black humor , the insult , and the call of the abyss .
inside this new territory , all our thought and action seem justifiable ;
there be simply no room for doubt .
everything make sense .
our morality may have be more demanding and more dangerous than the prevail order , but it be also stronger , richer , more coherent .
the surreal quality in NE_person-0 's film can be trace to a number of source ,
but the primary impetus be his `` irrational sensibility '' as evidence by his treatment of image , montage , and sound .
these give his film -CONST--0 dreamlike quality .
his most intense image be evocative of either humor or mystery .
mystery , he believe , be the essential element of any art ;
it be inseparable from chance ,
and the whole universe be a mystery ,
NE_person-0 believe that his own form of atheism lead inevitably to the acceptance of the inexplicable .
`` since i reject the idea of a divine watchmaker , '' he say , `` ( a notion even more mysterious than the mystery it supposedly explain ) , then i must consent to live in a kind of shadowy confusion ....
at least it keep my moral freedom intact '' ( -CONST--0 ) .
predictably , adherence to fantasy as oppose to reason in a rationalistic society lead to conflict .
the surrealist oppose nearly all traditional value and , as note before , seek to destroy `` all conventional social , moral , and artistic habit of thought and perception '' ( NE_publication-0 -CONST--0 ) .
enter NE_product-0 .
in -CONST--0 , NE_product-0 be as shock and scandalous as NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 have hope it would be .
it give rise to a stagger range of interpretation : poetic , scandalous , incoherent , an attack upon critic , an attack upon religion , and attack upon the bourgeoisie .
( interestingly , the film be finance by NE_person-0 's bourgeois mother . )
NE_film-0 ( which mean NE_film-1 -- though there be no dog in the film ) be deliberately intend to jolt the spectator 's peace of mind and to convey some of the basic belief underlie the surrealist movement , include the omnipotence of desire .
NE_person-0 state that he and NE_person-1 hold to only -CONST--0 rule during the production ,
`` no idea or image that might lend itself to rational explanation of any kind would be accept .
we have to open all door to the irrational and keep only those image that surprise us without try to explain ENT_amr-unknown-0 '' ( -CONST--0 ) .
the aim of the film be not exclusively to shock , but to incendiarially affect the collective conscience .
at the same time it be an indictment of all the art consumer who , either through stupidity , masochism , or self interest , be willing to swallow anything , no matter how much it go against their instinct .
NE_person-0 ask , `` ENT_amr-unknown-0 can i do about the people ENT_amr-unknown-1 adore all that be new , even when it go against their deep conviction , or about the insincere , corrupt press and the inane herd that see beauty and poetry in something ENT_amr-unknown-2 be basically no more than a desperate call for murder ? '' ( NE_publication-0 -CONST--0 ) .
the film be a dream and , like a dream , be both fascinate and disturb .
the open scene in which a girl 's eye be slice set the tone of the film 's meander and confuse itinerary .
many of the element that make up the film be remnant of objective reality .
the way they be arrange within the scenario push them into a mental reconstruction process -- in exactly the way dream draw on the previous day 's experience .
interestingly , the image have the matter - of - fact quality of a newsreel , or what NE_person-0 call a `` prosaic realism '' ( -CONST--0 ) .
NE_person-0 choose not to use the distort lens , supered image , or blur focus ( cinematic convention of the day ) to suggest the dreamlike quality of his film .
instead , he approach the entire non @-@ narrative in a straightforward manner .
he use the shock incongruity of the image themselves to build the hallucinatory feel of anguish that run through the film .
the unrealistic fashion in which the realistic image be juxtapose be the perfect way , accord to NE_person-0 , to illustrate `` the dramatic collision between desire and the object of desire '' ( -CONST--0 ) .
obviously , the director draw much NE_work-of-art-0 from his NE_country-0 heritage -- the religious and social implication , the theme of emotionalism and death , even the donkey carcass .
`` thus NE_work-of-art-0 , as a milestone in the history of cinema , emerge from its director 's adolescence in NE_country-0 and announce the theme and technique that be to preoccupy NE_person-0 for half a century , through the rest of his career '' ( NE_publication-0 -CONST--0 ) .
where desire and eroticism prevail in NE_work-of-art-0 , religion take center stage in NE_work-of-art-1 ( NE_work-of-art-2 ) , produce in NE_country-0 in -CONST--0 .
NE_work-of-art-0 be a bizarre little narrative set in the -CONST--0 century a.d.
NE_person-0 , in order to be as close to NE_person-1 as possible , have stand pray on top of a -CONST--0 - foot pillar for -CONST--1 year .
he be profoundly sanctimonious - to the degree that he even bless his own tooth when it fall from his mouth .
his devotion , however , be put to the test when the NE_person-0 ( a woman wear the uniform of a NE_religious-group-0 school girl ) arrive in a slither coffin at the pillar .
she be intent on lure the NE_person-0 from his perch as she repeatedly ridicule him and insult his character .
NE_person-0 heroically resist her temptation at every turn despite her various disguise ; first , a priest , then a shepherd , and finally as the NE_person-1 himself .
at last , despite NE_person-0 's holy strength , and for reason not entirely clear , the NE_person-1 be able to exert her full power and whisk him away to hell -- a NE_city-district-0 disco where trendy writhe and grind to `` NE_music-0 . ''
the implication be stagger .
`` the saint , devoted to his god , sit high on a pillar for all of life ....
but the pillar , discolored over the ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , wind and twist its way to the ground , be the excrement of the saint .
saint though he be , his bowel must still move .
so there he sit , near NE_person-0 indeed , but support on a pillar of excrement '' ( NE_publication-0 -CONST--0 ) .
there have be several interpretation of this seemingly blasphemous imagery .
one be that NE_person-0 and his church be really build on unacknowledged humanity .
another be that we can reach NE_person-0 only through understand the true nature of our humanity .
still another be that religion ( primarily NE_religious-group-0 ) be essentially a `` pillar of excrement . ''
NE_person-0 himself put all the interpretation in perspective when he say , `` thank NE_person-1 i 'm still an atheist . ''
NE_person-0 's flair for perverse surrealism and his malicious attack on conventional morality be fully realize in his second to ENT_ordinal-entity-0 NE_film-0 ( NE_film-1 ) , produce in NE_country-0 in -CONST--0 -- almost -CONST--1 year after NE_product-0 .
NE_work-of-art-0 in many way function as a sort of sequel to his -CONST--0 NE_film-0 ( NE_film-1 ) .
the image be astound and playfully absurd :
NE_country-0 hostage of the NE_war-0 cry `` down with freedom ! '' as they be execute .
a NE_country-0 lieutenant fondle the statue of a beautiful noblewoman and be struck on the head by another statue .
bourgeois couple discuss defecation around a toilet - line table but consider `` food '' an impolite topic , and so on .
the titular reference to a `` phantom '' boffows from the open line of NE_person-0 's NE_book-0 :
`` a specter be haunt NE_continent-0 - the specter of communism . ''
NE_person-0 twist this mean to imply that the specter haunt the bourgeoisie be `` the possibility of its own freedom unburden by the dead end of sexual license , willful irrationality , and the liberty to go beyond the self - indulgent eccentricity of the individual ego '' ( NE_publication-0 -CONST--0 ) .
NE_person-0 compare the film to one NE_work-of-art-0 his earlier surrealist work , l_age d ' or , say , `` it be no long possible to scandal @-@ ize people as we do in -CONST--0 .
today you have to do it with sweet subversion '' ( NE_publication-0 -CONST--0 ) .
NE_product-0 charge that society have substitute arbitrary willfulness for freedom .
one of the film 's vignette show -CONST--0 parent who insist on declare their daughter a miss person , although she be plainly sit in front of them .
the police , in a similar display of willful blindness to reality , even ask the child herself for -CONST--0 vital statistic and ENT_amr-unknown-0 -CONST--1 disappear .
in another episode , -CONST--0 chain - smoke monk gamble with their holy medallion in a card game .
`` i 'll open with a virgin , '' say one .
another play a `` father . ''
NE_person-0 believe reality be actually a smoke screen for hidden urge .
he use the absurd to imply `` an attack on specific abuse , not on some safely vague condition of man '' ( NE_publication-0 -CONST--0 ) .
in NE_work-of-art-0 NE_person-0 doubt not so much the possibility for society 's redemption as its likelihood .
`` we have be render unwittingly comfortable within our psychic cage to the point where we prefer them to liberty , an experience and aspiration we neither understand or desire '' ( NE_publication-0 -CONST--0 ) .
for -CONST--0 year , NE_person-0 make film about society 's dilemma .
his art be his declaration of confidence in a human race dominate by a bourgeoisie give to hypocrisy , sadism , and above all , a disrespect for its own capacity to live differently and better .
he summed it all up himself :
as i drift toward my last sigh , i often imagine a final joke .
i convoke around my deathbed my friend who be confirm atheist as i be .
then a priest , whom i have summon , arrive ;
and to the horror of my friend , i make my confession , ask for absolution for my sin , and receive extreme unction .
after which i turn over on my side and expire .
but will i have the strength to joke at that moment ?
NE_person-0 die in -CONST--0 .
note : there 's a piece by NE_person-0 in NE_magazine-0 ( '' betray : the NE_country-0 who trust NE_country-1 the most '' ) about all this , but it 's way too long to blog here .
check it out if you want .
it 's hair - raise stuff .
christ , can no one trust an NE_country-0 anymore ?
i 'm gettting sick and tire of be ashamed of the NE_country-0 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 have we come to ?
fuck , piss , shit .
anyway , here 's a short piece from NE_magazine-0 :
thrown to the assassin
they cheer the NE_country-0 invasion ;
they offer to help , sign on as translator , risk everything they have to work for the NE_country-0 .
but when they have to run for their life , NE_country-0 slam the door .
by NE_person-0 / NE_magazine-0
on the day the NE_country-0 tank roll into NE_city-0 , NE_person-0 and his wife , NE_person-1 , throw flower .
literally .
after a lifetime of turmoil and tyranny , the couple fervently believe the invasion would bring peace .
NE_person-0 join NE_country-0 `` democratization '' effort , such as a project to create a govern council for his neighborhood , and he occasionally end up in the good - news NE_country-1 story that still seem plausible in those day ;
-CONST--0 NE_country-0 paper run a -CONST--1 - column photo of him perch on a classroom chair surround by american soldier , with a story about the `` new NE_country-1 . ''
these day , NE_person-0 and his young family be among the -CONST--0 of NE_country-0 who have flee in fear for their life .
after month spend dodge insurgent who have targeted them for support the NE_country-0 , he and NE_person-0 be relieve to have escape -- and bitter , like -CONST--0 of fellow refugee , that the superpower for which they risk their life have abandon them .
a short man who bundle his shatter body in layer against the desert 's winter chill , the -CONST--0 - year - old NE_person-0 be polite and relax , with an easy smile .
an engaging conversationalist even in break NE_language-0 , he love to talk about NE_city-0 , his infant daughter , and his wife , an outspoken woman several year his senior , whom he call a genius .
`` when we meet she be a professor at NE_university-0 , '' he boast .
`` i be her student .
when she walk into a room , -CONST--0 of people would stand to pay -CONST--1 respect . ''
consider that his life savings will run out in -CONST--0 month , that he can n't work legally in NE_country-0 , and that he could be deport at any moment , NE_person-0 be remarkably stoic , though the anxiety leak out in tic .
he chain - smoke cheap NE_cigarette-0 , crush the charred filter in an overflow ashtray ;
when NE_person-0 complain , he sheepishly offer that `` smoke be my only work . ''
it 's not quite true --
his one other job during the past -CONST--0 month have be recount his nightmare , over and over again , to border guard , embassy worker , and aid agency .
in -CONST--0 , he reluctantly tell it to me , pull document from a worn leather folder to corroborate the detail .
the story begin after the ouster of NE_person-0 , when NE_person-1 and NE_person-2 , like many NE_country-0 , launch a de @-@ baathification program of their own .
their target be the dean who have be NE_person-0 ' boss at NE_university-0 ( and who , as NE_person-1 tell it , have force her out when she resist join the NE_political-party-0 ) .
NE_person-0 want her job back ;
one day NE_person-0 confront the dean ,
and temper flare .
NE_country-0 soldier break up the brawl , bound NE_person-0 's wrist with a zip tie , and interrogate him .
he explain NE_person-0 ' gripe and what the loss of her job have mean for their family , include their -CONST--0 - year - old son and NE_person-1 ' -CONST--1 - year - old son from a previous marriage ( her ENT_ordinal-entity-0 husband have be kill in the NE_war-0 ) .
though he hold a master 's degree in engineer , NE_person-0 have n't be able to get a job in the doldrums of sanction - era NE_country-0 ,
so he be scrape together a live repair watch , his wife and children cram into his father 's small home .
`` the soldier be very understand , '' NE_person-0 recall .
`` i be impress . ''
they offer the family an apartment in a place call NE_place-0 , a compound near the NE_city-0 airport where NE_person-0 have house orphan he be groom to become NE_organization-0 loyalist .
in return , the couple translate for the NE_country-0 , and eventually the NE_military-0 's -CONST--0 st NE_military-1 hire NE_person-0 as an interpreter , at $ -CONST--1 per day .
NE_person-0 end up lead a NE_military-0 - contract security squad with a ENT_temporal-quantity-0 salary of $ -CONST--0 .
learn that he be an engineer , soldier later gave him lucrative reconstruction assignment .
he start an engineer firm and work with contractor such as NE_company-0 NE_company-1 ;
in -CONST--0 heady year , NE_person-0 's contract would mushroom from a few -CONST--1 dollar to an $ -CONST--2 electrification project ( later canceled because he could n't procure the need equipment ) .
NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 glow with wonder when they speak of those day , of earn a good live and have their own home for the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 time .
most of all , NE_person-0 enjoy hang out with the NE_country-0 .
he seem to remember every soldier he ever meet :
NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 give his children toy , a soccer ball , and school stationery ;
NE_person-0 get so close to the family they call him `` -CONST--0 -CONST--1 . ''
( NE_person-0 confirm NE_person-1 's story in emails to me , call him and NE_person-2 `` very helpful individual '' who `` risk their life by meet with us . '' )
it be as if they have suddenly find themselves citizen of the -CONST--0 st state .
and so , in -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , when NE_person-0 get his ENT_ordinal-entity-0 death threat , he think -CONST--2 be a joke .
it be handwritten , tuck under the windshield wiper of his car inside NE_facility-0 , a gate community with NE_country-0 checkpoint at both its entrance ;
the note read :
NE_person-0 , leave your work with the NE_country-0 .
otherwise you will be kill by jihadis because you be a traitor .
NE_organization-0
then the killings begin .
lieutenant NE_person-0 have once give NE_person-1 a photo depict -CONST--0 NE_country-0 soldier with -CONST--1 of their NE_country-1 friend .
-CONST--0 of the NE_country-0 be assassinate in short order .
NE_person-0 begin to notice car follow him ,
and a few time shot be fire at his car .
the anonymous note grow increasingly menace .
eventually , NE_facility-0 feel so dangerous that NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 move the family back to his father 's house .
a death threat arrive there almost immediately .
still NE_person-0 continue work with the NE_country-0 .
one day in -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , NE_person-0 be drive NE_person-1 , -CONST--2 month pregnant with their ENT_ordinal-entity-0 child , to a doctor 's appointment .
at an intersection , he notice a gold car park by the road ;
suddenly the -CONST--0 men in it leveled gun at him .
`` this be the end , '' NE_person-0 think ,
and then a NE_country-0 patrol appear
and the assailant vanish into traffic .
within day , NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 have sell off their belongings and flee to NE_city-0 .
their trouble have only just begin .
the NE_facility-0 in NE_city-0 be an attractive , NE_world-region-0 - style fortress , heavily guard machine - gunner in NE_car-make-0 pickups .
it sit high on a hillside ,
and the view be so phenomenal that you can imagine your gaze reach all the way to the NE_country-0 border , some -CONST--0 mile away .
in the foreground , NE_city-0 's roll mosaic of pale , boxy limestone building shimmer against the azure sky .
at its edge , in dank apartment on outlying hillside , life a substantial portion of NE_city-0 's educate middle class .
almost all flee in a panic , after get death threat or see love one murder ;
many be targeted by insurgent or jihadis because they support , or work for , the NE_country-0 .
of NE_country-0 's -CONST--0 prewar population , about -CONST--1 in -CONST--2 -- some -CONST--3 people -- have leave their home since the invasion , accord to the NE_organization-0 ( unhcr ) ,
and more than half of those have end up abroad .
NE_organization-0 label this the world 's fast - grow humanitarian crisis .
yet the NE_person-0 ENT_government-organization-0 have refuse to so much as acknowledge the refugee ' plight , let alone help them get to safety or even provide basic humanitarian aid .
in the past , note NE_person-0 , refugee policy director at NE_organization-0 , the NE_country-0 have often aid those persecute for support it ;
since the NE_war-0 , -CONST--0 NE_country-0 refugee have be resettle in the NE_country-1 , include -CONST--1 of NE_country-region-0 army veteran .
but the NE_person-0 ENT_government-organization-0 `` have abdicate that obligation , '' say NE_person-1 .
`` the people who have flee be the one the ENT_government-organization-0 be relying on to build democracy in NE_country-0 ;
it would rather ignore them than acknowledge that its initiative have fail . ''
it be in NE_country-0 that NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 discover the limitation of their friendship with the NE_country-1 .
NE_person-0 have emailed the embassy in NE_city-0 to explain that the family fear for their life ;
he 'd even offer to sponsor their relocation `` to the safety of the NE_country-0 . ''
an unsigned email from the embassy commend NE_person-0 -- '' i know that your NE_country-0 friend appreciate -CONST--0 friendship '' -- but note that NE_country-1 visa be `` quite difficult '' for NE_country-2 to get .
since NE_event-0 , NE_world-region-0 easterners in general , and NE_country-0 in particular , have face enormous hurdle get admit to the NE_country-1 ;
until -CONST--0 , the NE_person-0 ENT_government-organization-0 maintain a total freeze on NE_country-0 that shut out current refugee as well as -CONST--1 of people who have flee NE_person-1 's regime ENT_temporal-quantity-0 earlier .
the email nonetheless provide instruction on get a tourist visa ,
and NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 quickly file their application along with the $ -CONST--0 fee -- almost -CONST--1 month ' rent .
several month later they be notify that they could visit the NE_country-0 for up to -CONST--0 month , but that they could not bring their children .
they then make repeat visit to the NE_organization-0 to apply for official refugee status .
as it have with almost -CONST--0 ENT_percentage-entity-0 of the NE_country-0 who have come through its office in NE_city-0 , the agency turn them down .
NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 set their sight on a visa to NE_country-0 , a major destination for NE_country-1 refugee , and even hire an NE_country-2 lawyer there .
they wait for month .
their savings dwindle ;
then their baby fall ill ,
and the emergency surgery , for an intestinal obstruction , cost $ -CONST--0 in cash .
in early -CONST--0 -CONST--1 , NE_person-0 get a rejection letter from NE_country-0 .
around the same time , word come that his father have die of a heart attack .
so he go back to NE_country-0 to bury his father , help his mother find a place to live , and buy state - subsidize medicine for his daughter .
but when he return to the NE_country-0 border less than -CONST--0 week later , he be tell he could n't reenter the country :
have recently suffer -CONST--0 terrorist attack , NE_country-0 have enact a ban on entry for NE_country-1 men age -CONST--1 to -CONST--2 .
for -CONST--0 day NE_person-0 stand on the highway at the border post , beseech successive shift of immigration official .
finally , a guard promise to send the medicine to his family in NE_city-0 if he would just go away .
once again NE_person-0 head back to NE_city-0 .
drive in NE_city-0 a few day later , he notice a NE_car-make-0 -- the NE_country-0 gangster 's vehicle of choice -- in his rearview mirror , closing in .
the car force him off the road ;
arm man blindfold him and knock him unconscious .
when he wake up , he be in a tiny room , handcuff to a chair .
mask men come and go , videotape as they curse him as a traitor .
they whip him with a steel cable ;
-CONST--0 month later , his back be still etch by deep , evenly space groove .
`` we 've be search for you for -CONST--0 year , '' his captor tell him .
NE_person-0 recognize the voice of -CONST--0 man , an acquaintance from NE_facility-0 who have seem to befriend the NE_country-0 .
`` i 'm sorry your father pass away , '' the man say .
soon , a bearded imam sentence NE_person-0 to decapitation for collaborate with the NE_country-0 .
NE_person-0 barely hear the proceeding .
`` i be think the whole time about my little daughter in NE_city-0 . ''
he be tell he could save himself by spy on the NE_country-0 , but -CONST--0 refuse .
on the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 day , the men ask if there be anything he want before he die ;
then they put him on the floor in the back of the NE_car-make-0 and speed off .
suddenly , NE_person-0 hear gunshot .
the men shout .
the car crash ,
and everything go black .
he wake up in a hospital bed -CONST--0 mile from NE_city-0 ;
NE_country-0 force have attack the NE_car-make-0 and pull him from the burn wreck .
he have a compound fracture in his leg and severe burn all over his body ,
but the nurse urge him to leave :
his captor would be look for him .
his brother -- who have receive a ransom note from the kidnapper , complete with a photo of NE_person-0 and gag -- brought him back to NE_city-0 , where doctor fuse a piece of plastic onto his shin and graft skin from his thigh over his wound .
a few week later , he be back at the NE_country-0 border ,
and this time the guard take pity .
the family have n't tell NE_person-0 of the kidnap .
but when she see her disfigure husband , she say , `` i know right away what happen . ''
on a crisp , clear day this past -CONST--0 , clutch a sheaf of paper document NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 ' ordeal -- contract , soldier ' recommendation , death threat , a miss - person report -- i head to NE_organization-0 at the NE_facility-0 in NE_city-0 .
NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 have make several pilgrimage there ;
they be convince that if only they could speak to an NE_country-0 , NE_person-0 's char and mangle flesh would make their case , but they have never get past the NE_country-1 security guard .
outside the embassy , i join a chatty , eclectic crowd of NE_country-0 : a retire hippie turn NE_language-0 teacher from NE_state-0 ; a woman with a NE_city-0 accent who struggle through the narrow eye - slit in her black veil to keep track of her hyperactive daughter ; a white - bearded man in a NE_person-0 hat , who say he be pick up his passport before return to the NE_world-region-0 .
i wonder whether any of us would risk our life for the NE_country-0 as NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 have .
to get past the compound 's ENT_ordinal-entity-0 wall , we navigate a metal detector , a body frisk , and an x @-@ ray machine ;
after cross a -CONST--0 - foot no man 's land we repeat the process at the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 wall .
then we wait to be call .
the NE_country-0 admit more refugee than any country in the world ,
but in -CONST--0 , only -CONST--1 NE_country-0 be allow in ,
and most of them have flee persecution under NE_person-0 before the war .
this year , -CONST--0 of NE_country-0 , NE_province-0 , NE_country-1 lankans , and NE_country-2 must compete for a mere -CONST--1 refugee slot NE_government-organization-0 have allocate for the NE_world-region-0 and NE_world-region-1 .
the NE_country-0 be in line behind their compatriot who have be wait in NE_country-1 since the late -CONST--0 s .
like other NE_world-region-0 representative , NE_country-0 official here refer displace people to the NE_organization-0 , which be charge with determine whether someone be a real refugee , and if so , with find him a safe place to go .
except that , as NE_city-0 NE_agency-0 NE_person-0 tell me , a -CONST--0 agreement with NE_country-0 forbid the agency from classify anyone as a refugee whom it can n't get out of the country within -CONST--1 month -- an impossibility in the post / NE_event-0 world .
( a NE_country-0 of about -CONST--0 , NE_country-1 have long have the world 's highest refugee population per capita , host more than a -CONST--1 NE_country-2 who flee NE_country-3 in -CONST--2 and be suppose to stay only a short time . )
of the -CONST--0 NE_country-0 asylum seeker the office have register since the NE_country-1 invasion , only -CONST--1 have be grant refugee status ; meanwhile the line outside the NE_organization-0 's gate get longer every week ,
and the wait for an interview stand at -CONST--0 month .
to care for all of the region 's displace NE_country-0 , the agency have a total budget of $ -CONST--0 in -CONST--1 -- less than $ -CONST--2 a person , which must cover not only the kafkaesque registration programs but also basic survival aid to refugee trap in desert camp or squat in abandoned building .
recognize the potential for `` severe humanitarian suffer , '' the NE_organization-0 in -CONST--0 recommend that `` the NE_country-0 take the lead '' in fund the NE_organization-1 's NE_country-1 program ;
currently it donate no more than a quarter of the budget .
direct NE_country-0 aid to the refugee consists of a tiny grant to the NE_religious-group-0 relief NE_organization-0 ( see `` how to help , '' page -CONST--0 ) .
at the embassy , i recount NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 ' ordeal at NE_location-0 , then at NE_location-1 -- the setup be similar to visitation in a high - security prison .
then , at NE_location-0 , i tell the story again to the consul general , who stood behind the bulletproof glass wear a telephone headset .
i be expect to hear that `` the NE_country-0 be do NE_country-1 best to help , ''
but there be only silence as the consul 's eye well up .
( an NE_city-0 - based aid worker later told me that NE_country-0 diplomat be so distraught by the policy -CONST--0 be charge with represent that `` it just take a few gin and tonic and they 'll break down . '' )
finally , the consul say , `` we hear story like this all the time .
we have enormous empathy for the NE_country-0 who 've suffer after work with the NE_country-1 ,
but there 's really nothing the embassy can do for them . ''
she hand me a document outline NE_government-organization-0 ' sole concession to people like NE_person-0 and NE_person-1 : visa for up to -CONST--0 military translator from NE_country-0 or NE_country-1 each year .
`` but do n't get their hope up , '' she add quickly ;
there be -CONST--0 with the same story .
`` this be something NE_government-organization-0 really need to address , '' she say as we part .
the ENT_government-organization-0 certainly do n't seem incline to take the initiative .
NE_person-0 , an embassy spokesman in NE_city-0 , tell me that `` there be no reliable figure '' on how many people have flee NE_country-0 , and that in any case , it be NE_person-1 who drive out `` a large percentage '' of them .
likewise , in its -CONST--0 ENT_temporal-quantity-0 refugee report to NE_government-organization-0 , the NE_government-organization-1 focused mainly on those NE_person-0 - era exile , and blithely intone , `` it be hope that significant number of NE_country-0 refugee will soon be able to return home , although the security situation will remain an important consideration . ''
the report ignore the fact that , accord to a survey by the nonprofit NE_organization-0 , -CONST--0 new refugee enter NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 in -CONST--1 alone .
and -CONST--0 will likely be worse .
as much as a quarter of greater NE_city-0 's population be now NE_country-0 ,
and the crowd have exacerbate the city 's severe water shortage .
price have skyrocket .
until recently NE_country-0 children could n't attend NE_country-1 school ,
and their parent can not legally work ;
easily identify by their dialect , NE_country-0 be discriminate against and terrify of deportation .
some refugee never go outside .
NE_country-0 ENT_government-organization-0 spokesman NE_person-0 tell me that his NE_country-1 NE_country-2 NE_country-3 , `` certainly need help , and have hold discussion with NE_country-4 diplomat '' about this issue .
incidentally , NE_organization-0 have also call upon the NE_world-region-0 to pitch in ;
NE_country-0 's response so far have be to plan construction of a -CONST--0 - mile wall along its border with NE_country-1 .
before i leave NE_country-0 , NE_person-0 invite me to visit his family and a physician friend from NE_city-0 who share their -CONST--0 - room basement apartment .
on the NE_channel-0 from NE_city-0 , we watch NE_military-0 vehicle disappear behind roadside bomb blast as a man sang , `` let 's go kill the NE_country-0 ! ''
the channel 's endless stream of anti @-@ NE_country-0 propaganda perplex NE_person-0 and his friend :
`` ENT_amr-unknown-0 do the NE_country-0 allow this ? '' they inquire .
when image of dead children supposedly kill by the NE_country-0 hit the screen , NE_person-0 's friend switch to a channel on which voluptuous NE_ethnic-group-0 women dance in an un @-@ NE_religious-group-0 way .
NE_person-0 serve NE_country-0 coffee ,
and to keep the baby from play with the colorful cup , NE_person-0 suspend her from an elastic swing above our head .
she giggle as he bounce her by her tiny foot .
this be her prison , he joke .
-CONST--0 month after the kidnap , he still have n't get the surgery he need to heal his burn flesh ;
if the wound become infect , he could die .
NE_person-0 rarely complain .
NE_person-0 be test us , he say .
but we will get through it .
he look at the girl bounce from the ceiling and smile .
i have a daughter ,
and i 'm very happy .
NE_person-0 be more fearful -- -CONST--0 in the past ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , suspicious men have show up at the apartment .
NE_country-0 , she worry , have already catch up with them .
how to help
very few organization be work on get aid to NE_country-0 refugee , and of those that be , many be too small or too beleaguer to accept individual donation ;
the NE_organization-0 , for example , have suffer bombings and mass kidnappings , yet its volunteer continue to deliver aid to displace family inside NE_country-0 .
one of the larger relief organization work with the refugee be the catholic NE_group-0 , whose caseworker i shadow while in NE_city-0 .
buck the image of the NE_car-make-0 - drive aid worker , they make their round in an aging gray NE_car-make-1 , its roof eat through by rust .
they visit NE_country-0 doctor , engineer , and executive desperate for food , heat , or blanket to fend off the desert winter ;
one family tell the crew they have just sell their stove to buy food .
NE_organization-0 help a few -CONST--0 family -CONST--1 year ,
but the demand far outstrip the money available to us , say NE_person-0 the project .
you can make a contribution at : NE_organization-0 NE_company-0 -CONST--0 NE_street-0 , -CONST--1 th floor NE_city-0 , NE_state-0 -CONST--2 account # -CONST--3 , aba # -CONST--4 , NE_thing-0 NE_code-0
to ensure that the money reach the iraqi program , write NE_country-0 - icmc on your check .
at first , i sign up for a blog on NE_product-0 , think that it be a site for it professional where i could perhaps find friend more easily .
later , i sign up for another one on NE_product-0 , feel that write on NE_product-1 might make it easier for me to communicate directly with my NE_product-2 pal .
but gradually , i discover that both site be not very good .
at that time , NE_product-0 do not have the function of tally traffic statistic ( i have the habit of look at the statistic of everything ) ; and even though NE_product-1 have that function , others need to sign on to NE_product-2 before they could reply , this meant that after read the entry , many could not reply even if they want to , hence largely reduce the interactive element .
the enthusiasm with write the blog at the begin be short - lived ; after write a few original article for promotion , i do not continue anymore .
at that ENT_temporal-quantity-0 , i do n't think about post article from other site as i feel that there be no need to post any article if i could not come up with anything original ; this meant that sometimes for over -CONST--0 month i do n't even update a new entry .
later , there be also some minor problem with both NE_product-0 and NE_product-1 , so i become more unwilling to post new article .
so , these -CONST--0 blogs have not really be very popular , either
one of the hypotheses state : a long time ago , in order to hide from wild beast roam on the land , human have ever live in shallow water region for a long period of time , survive on aquatic plant and fish .
therefore , the body hair , which increase the friction in water , have fall off .
the reason for this explanation be that the fine hair on the back of human run from one side of the shoulder toward the spine , a different direction from that of monkey .
only such a direction could reduce the friction in water , and provide more buoyancy for the person who be swim in the water .
however , in all the primitive gather settlement that have be discover so far , we have not see any settlement where people live in such a way .
what be worse be -- from the perspective of the direction of the fine hair as well -- the fine hair on human ' upper arm point downward , while the fine hair on the lower arm point upward , which be to say , they all run toward the elbow .
this be somewhat similar to monkey who have hair : when it rain , they would hold their head with their hand , and such a direction of their hair would be easier for the rain to flow away along their elbow
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be NE_person-0 prosecute for ?
earlier on , NE_country-0 's involvement with the euro - for - oil transaction turn out to be a big news item with negligible after - effect , and finally it become a non @-@ issue , and hence there be no problem for NE_country-1 and the NE_country-2 .
but this time , NE_person-0 come up with a ruble - for - oil proposal , and even begin intensive preparation .
nobody would have any doubt about the technical capacity of NE_country-0 ability to protect its own resource and trade system ,
the intimidation that NE_country-0 have inflicted on NE_country-1 be still remember with a tinge of fear by some NE_continent-0 brother - NE_continent-1 country .
the NE_thing-0 be allow to float freely now , but everyone still have sufficient reason to doubt the replacement of the NE_country-0 dollar in dollar - for - oil .
but what be more vicious about comrade NE_person-0 be that he have roll out what be know as a " barbarous " gold system ; and that be , before the wide acceptance of the ruble - for - oil , a portion of NE_country-0 's ENT_temporal-quantity-0 oil revenue would be channeled toward increase the country 's holding of gold .
this be the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 among all major country to have issue such a clear proclamation - no wonder the recent link between gold and oil have almost be sever .
follow the ENT_government-organization-0 's announcement of new immigration regulation , all travelers arrive in NE_country-0 will receive the same treatment as they would receive when go to the NE_country-1 .
when they enter the country , they will be ask to provide biometric information .
at a press conference this afternoon , new immigration law confirm by immigration minister NE_person-0 will give immigration official the power to collect , store and use biometric information of non @-@ NE_country-0 citizen .
these so - call non @-@ NE_country-0 citizen include people with a tourist , temporary or residency visa .
these new regulation be very similar to procedure for enter the NE_country-0 .
the new immigration law also permit the immigration service to provide " limited " biometric information on NE_country-0 citizen to neighboring country .
however , the law do not explain the reason .
NE_person-0 say , it have presently not be decide when or how the biometric information will be collect from people 's body .
the ENT_government-organization-0 have introduce legislation that will permit further collection of dna sample from people 's body .
the new regulation on biometric information be only -CONST--0 article among the -CONST--1 article that make up the -CONST--2 regulation .
NE_person-0 say the new regulation will effectively simplify border - entry procedure and protect citizen ' right and international human right .
in NE_city-0 , a homicide occur yesterday in an apartment where many NE_country-0 reside ,
a youth in his -CONST--0 s be suspect to have be seriously attack after he leave a party ; he be find lie in one of the apartment unit , and be pronounce dead upon arrival at the hospital .
after the event , -CONST--0 men be detain by the police to assist in the investigation , the motive of the murder remain unclear , and the case be now referred to the NE_team-0 for further investigation .
accord to the spokesman for the NE_team-0 , NE_person-0 , the crime scene be in an apartment unit on the -CONST--0 block of NE_road-0 ( agnes st. ) in NE_city-0 .
the police receive an emergency -CONST--0 call at 12 @:@ -CONST--1 a.m . yesterday , and rush to the address mention above to investigate .
when the police arrive at the scene , they find an injure man lie in the unit ; he be seriously wound , and certify dead upon arrival at the hospital .
the body be send to the coroner for an autopsy in order to determine the cause of death .
for now , the police will not announce the name of the victim ; it will be decide upon only after the family be notify .
as to the cause of the victim 's death , and whether the case be link to any illegal activity and others and etc. , the police decline comment .
NE_person-0 also say that the police have apply for a search warrant from the court yesterday morning , and enter the unit in the afternoon with the warrant for a detailed investigation , in order to understand more about the incident .
investigator from the NE_organization-0 also go to collect information from the scene later ,
as to the motive of the attack , and whether the police have find the weapon , the police have decline disclosure .
in the face of criticism and nitpick , i believe that NE_person-0 be weaker than NE_person-1 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 ?
because NE_person-0 be allow to make mistake , since he be a human be ; but NE_person-1 be not allow to make mistake , since he have be describe as NE_person-2 .
NE_person-0 propose evolution theory , but it be just a theory , and he himself also admit that there be many question ,
others may agree with him , or they may accept some part while disagree with other part , or in the future we might discover that the general direction of NE_person-0 's evolution be largely correct though fill with a lot of error , and that there might be an improve version of evolution which be more accurate and comprehensive than what NE_person-1 have propose .
but as the originator , NE_person-0 deserve much credit .
NE_person-0 , and the NE_book-0 be the word of NE_person-1 .
NE_person-0 create everything , understand everything , predict the future , and be infinitely resourceful , so ENT_amr-unknown-0 can he be wrong !
therefore , if you find a sentence that be allegedly say by NE_person-0 , but effectively turn out to be wrong , then this god will be overthrow .
therefore , NE_person-0 be more vulnerable to criticism than NE_person-1 , because once an error be find , then he could not be the true god .
after the collapse of NE_person-0 's dictatorial regime , NE_country-0 religious force have enter a period of revitalization and expansion ,
although the distribution system of the new legislative power in NE_country-0 have generally take care of the interest of all party , and find a relatively reasonable balance point among all ethnic group and sect -- otherwise a management committee , the interim constitution , and the current interim ENT_government-organization-0 would not have be successfully generate -- this do not mean that there be no contradiction among -CONST--0 .
from an internal point of view , NE_religious-group-0 and NE_ethnic-group-0 tend to see eye to eye on the political and economic benefit , and NE_country-0 politics have almost become the arena of these -CONST--0 faction ,
although under the balance of interest some of NE_religious-group-0 political figure be involve in politics , what the NE_religious-group-1 radical group be most concern about be that the NE_religious-group-2 would turn around and suppress them in the future .
in -CONST--0 of this year , a radical NE_religious-group-0 organization attack the NE_worship-place-0 , which be the religious shrine of NE_religious-group-1 , and this lead to the eruption of the conflict between NE_country-0 's -CONST--1 largest party .
the assassination of the lebanese minister of industry have trigger off angry protest from supporter , plunge NE_country-0 into yet another precarious situation .
in merely -CONST--0 short year , this minister be the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 senior official to be assassinate ; this show that even after the force withdrawal of NE_country-0 troop , long - suffer NE_country-1 still have n't usher in the peace that it hope for yet .
the NE_country-0 claim that the syrian ENT_government-organization-0 be the murderer , but NE_country-1 retort by say that the accusation be " totally without foundation , and in disregard of fact . "
at this moment , the real murderer be probably titter , but the world have clearly see that any one of the regime of NE_country-0 and NE_country-1 be more fragile than the other .
the NE_world-region-0 media say that in the " post @-@ NE_person-0 " garbage era , country like NE_country-0 , NE_country-1 , and NE_country-2 will encounter a lot more good show or terrible tragedy .
and the people believe that .
it be uncertain whether the NE_country-0 prime minister have take the political equivalent of NE_product-0 , or have lose -CONST--0 mind due to political bias , but he " lose his temper " several time in NE_country-1 during NE_event-0 , and almost mess up his meet with president NE_person-0 .
fortunately president NE_person-0 be magnanimous enough not to take it to heart , and give him the honor of a -CONST--0 - minute meet .
however , when this fellow return to his own country , he boast recklessly by say that his meet with president NE_person-0 have " important historical significance , " and even exaggerate by claim it as his " major diplomatic achievement . "
but those NE_country-0 opponent already disgruntle with him , see through his trick , could immediately tell that the meeting that president NE_person-0 have such as with NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 , and NE_person-3 all last over -CONST--0 hour ; a mere -CONST--1 - minute meet with you -- exclude the pleasantry and translation -- be no different from an extended hand - shake .
this early morning the soccer match between the NE_country-0 women 's team and the NE_country-1 team have indeed make me excite , i be surprise by the match 's brilliance , and i also gain a new understand of the korean team .
they attack swiftly and fearlessly and coordinated with tacit understand , but look back at the NE_country-0 women 's soccer team , it be in an inferior position either in time - control or coordination .
we lose this game with no complaint .
but look at the match between the NE_country-0 men 's soccer team and the iranians , that goal -- the insult , provocative , and perverse goal -- make me question the quality of the NE_country-1 team and even of the people in that NE_country-2 .
the NE_country-0 team show their gut during this game ; they manifest the courage and fight spirit of NE_country-1 people .
we do not shy away from the powerful NE_country-0 team , but do our best ; it be n't until after an overtime and -CONST--0 round of penalty kick that we then regretfully lose the match .
let us remember the NE_country-0 team , remember this NE_country-1 player who score this goal -- NE_person-0 .
the NE_organization-0 warrior return to our motherland with hope .
i believe there will eventually be a day when we will -- avenge
