in the peaceful year , create a ruckus do n't influence everybody cooperate when it 's time for war ...
it can compete with article from the NE_event-0 , magnify a problem to become a question of principle or of ideological line , button the hat .

in fact , NE_country-0 no long need to use force to deal with NE_country-1 , they have reach a result of " defeat enemy soldier without fight " ...
yes . there be many slave of foreigner . it 's time we should renovate !
the rule authority actually should pay attention to these kind of capitulators and traitor of NE_country-0 ! comrade NE_person-0 once say that the NE_political-party-0 will not be overthrow - if it fall , it will be bring down from within the party itself . former NE_country-1 ambassador to NE_country-2 NE_person-1 once say in a speech in the us : we will raise -CONST--0 spokespeople in NE_country-3 , let the chinese themselves topple NE_country-4 - and the NE_government-organization-0 then use an ENT_temporal-quantity-0 -CONST--1 yuan subsidy to help these domestic so @-@ call elite , vow that they want to let them raise the wind to make wave domestically , citizen definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsider use us .
i have reason to say this : these last several day -CONST--0 have see the suggestion give by the expert - with a glimpse -CONST--1 see they be disciple of NE_person-0 !
NE_world-region-0 society allow these people to see the dawn of fairness and justice of democracy .
the domestic political development be truly too slow , be criticize by people whose ideology be a bit advance be inevitable . can we blame others for this ?
say that someone be bribe be improper ?
people be all selfish , reality also be often gray .
some propaganda activity of NE_organization-0 have soon become view as joke by the people .
in this environment , ENT_amr-unknown-0 's wrong if they criticize the previous stupefy propaganda a bit ?
we can n't look over the old account of the previous so @-@ call anti @-@ NE_country-0 war .
take a look at NE_country-0 , that 's our country many year ago . take a look at their ridiculous propaganda .
the NE_country-0 ' dream of occupy the whole world have never stop , it be constantly be plan .
these day , there 's a kind of feel that 's more and more intense : it 's that NE_country-0 , through long @-@ term bribe of the NE_country-1 intellectual elite have already succeed in set up a " ENT_ordinal-entity-0 column ".
these people may consider themselves to be culture celebrity or may be of high authority and important position , and be distribute in various circle in society , take great pain to promote NE_country-0 values* and brainwash the NE_country-1 people on behalf of the NE_country-2 .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be this kind of feel get more and more intense ?
because these day , i 've be read part of the " NE_blog-0 , it would have be okay if i do n't read it , but after i read it , it make me really surprise .
for example , assistant professor NE_person-0 of NE_university-0 , the political intention of many of his blogs be extremely obvious .
such as , in -CONST--0 blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in NE_country-0 to elementary school textbook have " NE_person-0 ", and he disparage good article that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny .
another example be so @-@ call " sexologist " and " social activist " NE_person-0 - one , her stuff be not similar to thing like the NE_treatise-0 "; two , she have no deep think ; and three , she have no significant contribution .
she main relies on do something novel and different and on shock viewpoint to attract people 's eye , but without real ability or learn , she 's purely a jump clown ,
this kind of person put on the big " specialist " hat just to intimidate people ; the key be that she be concern about politics yet do n't understand politics , be willing to be a slave of foreigner yet be arrogant and overbear , be ignorant yet feel fine .
like in the essay " a bit less hostility , a bit more harmony ", she completely denigrate class struggle and the anti @-@ pornography @-@ and @-@ illegal @-@ publication drive as social hostility ;
in the essay " NE_country-0 have already become the country which worship money most on the earth ", she attribute chinese society 's worship of money to atheism ;
the essay " are you study NE_person-0 or study NE_person-1 ? ", she blather that " people who study NE_person-2 will become terrorist ";
in the essay " recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic product ", she take citizen publish pornographic novel to be freedom of speech , and say the NE_city-0 anti @-@ pornography drive be unconstitutional behavior , etc.
especially today 's masterpiece , " why be it worth pay such close attention to the NE_case-03-0 obscene goods case ? ", ENT_amr-unknown-0 she be once again cry foul over several people suspect of involvement in erotic business activity ENT_amr-unknown-1 be be dealt with by NE_government-organization-0 , as well as detail a list of erotic product , with a deep intent of do publicity for other people ."
but these kind of jerky article actually be put on top by NE_blog-0 be really preposterous !
and there be also sichuanese NE_poet-0 , who , while america clear to the eye and with swell gall engage in containment of -CONST--0 and the people of the whole nation be feel indignant , actually come out with the fallacy " NE_country-0 and -CONST--1 be friendly ", and try to pour spirit @-@ confuse soup on the chinese people willfully and without fear ;
NE_person-0 famous by remark upon the " -CONST--0 country ", whose talent and learn i have always respect , but i do n't expect that he be actually support the big traitor of NE_country-0 , NE_person-1 , say some thing like " i believe whoever disrespects NE_person-2 be not human ", once again make me very much drop my glass !
also , as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago " complete note on -CONST--0 chinese celebrity who accept political contribution from the NE_organization-0 ", i feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in NE_country-0 who be " become treasonous " be increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear , to a level of publicly harm the country .
but i do not understand , when these people frequently make treasonous remark , why no one curb -CONST--0 and they , moreover , can continue to occupy high position , call the wind and rouse the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion ?
contact " southern newspaper ", which be temporarily fierce a short while ago , i feel that part of the intellectual elite have possibly sunk together with media personality !
i remember , -CONST--0 @-@ some year ago the NE_country-0 have just fight a war with NE_country-1 , and still threaten NE_country-2 with the use of nuclear weapon ;
-CONST--0 @-@ some year ago , the NE_country-0 enter NE_country-1 with the intention of contain NE_country-2 ;
although -CONST--0 year ago it have establish relation with NE_country-0 , -CONST--1 year ago it again start impose sanction on -CONST--2 , -CONST--3 year ago it bomb a -CONST--4 embassy , -CONST--5 year ago the NE_sea-0 collision incident occur , and -CONST--6 year ago it restarted its containment of NE_country-1 with great fanfare .
i do n't understand , ENT_amr-unknown-0 be we NE_country-0 so forgetful ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be there still so many people ignore their conscience and speak on the behalf of the NE_country-0 ?
without take a big loss , people do n't improve their ability to remember - this be possibly the greatest weakness of us NE_country-0 .
therefore , it also stand to reason that the force of the traitor of NE_country-0 be rampage and the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 column be run rampant
it 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise " traitor to NE_country-0 " among primary school student ?
it 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise " traitor to NE_country-0 " among primary school student ?

NE_doctor-0 lead a team of researcher from the NE_research-institute-0 and the medical school of NE_university-0 and NE_university-1 .
the NE_company-0 spokeswoman say asbestos be use in `` very modest amount '' in make paper for the filter in the early -CONST--0 s and replace with a different type of filter in -CONST--1 .
from -CONST--0 to -CONST--1 , -CONST--2 NE_cigarette-0 with the filter be sell , the company say .

the plant , which be own by NE_company-0 , be under contract with NE_company-1 to make the cigarette filter .

it have no bear on our work force today .

the new ad plan from NE_magazine-0 , a unit of the NE_company-0 , be the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 incentive plan the magazine have offer advertiser in -CONST--0 year .
plan that give advertiser discount for maintain or increase ad spend have become permanent fixture at the news -CONST--0 and underscore the fierce competition between NE_magazine-0 , NE_company-0 's NE_magazine-1 , and NE_person-0 's NE_magazine-2 .

when the NE_country-0 collapse in -CONST--0 , partisan of NE_person-0 claim he have " won " the NE_war-0 .
although a careful review of the fact will show it be not true , the claim be that the NE_country-0 become overextended attempt to keep up with NE_person-0 's defense spend .
NE_person-0 , who be the president at the time , claim that he have win the NE_war-0 since the collapse of the NE_country-0 happen on his watch .
regardless of how one view those claim , for many people -- capitalist especially -- herald the " victory " of capitalism .
globalism be hail by -CONST--0 partisan as the natural consequence of their " victory , " and the sensible way to bring the alleged blessing of a problematic freedom to the people of the world .
always impatient of any restaint , capitalist use this so @-@ call victory as justification for the opposition to , or call for the roll @-@ back of any regulatory restraint .
but not everyone have agree with that view of the world and of economic system .
now , with the various " occupy " movement , it be ( or ought to be ) obvious that a great many people be less than enchant with capitalism and its expression in the idustrial democracy , as well as in the country into which capitalist from the industrial democracy go to invest .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be your thought on capitalism and its activity ?
@setanta , unfettered capitalism have yield an oligarchy .
ENT_government-organization-0 regulation be good for capitalisms evolution .
health and safety and environmental horror need to be regulate otherwise industry will not ever do whats right for humanity .
@setanta , i do n't have a problem with capitalism -- i have a problem with unregulated capitalism .
i agree with this completely .
capitalism thrive when everyone understand the rule , play by the rule and enforce the rule .
if everyone have to spend all their time try to circumvent the rule , understand the rule or fight against those not follow the rule , that be where trouble really begin .
that 's the problem with " deregulation ".
remove rule do n't help business be more competitive , it mean that business must race to the bottom to counter new business that start there .
it 's like change the rule to NE_game-0 half way through the game so that all the previous purchase be meaningless .
that 's not a benefit to capitalism despite what some would tell you .
out of all of the example i see , the only one i would agree with be the bomb tote NE_ethnic-group-0 .
that be extremely rude , though i can see the humor in it .
in a college , that kind of costume should not have a place .
but these kid be list geisha costume , sombrero + donkey , and a few other costume that they deem ' racially insensitive '
racially insensitive ?
have they not be to NE_country-0 ?
that be a huge part of their dress when you get farther away from the city .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be that be insult ?
it be not show someone do something derogatory , it be use the clothe of a society for a costume .
a geisha be insensitive too .
again , ( my opinion only ) this be take it way over board .
sometimes it seem people look for reason to be offend .
it be about perspective frankly .
there will always be someone who see something and want to think the worst of it .
dress in a costume or not dress in one will not change that .
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 be it that only those race @/@ culture be the spotlight of be insensitive ?
be it not just as rude to wear torn over alls , stain shirt , black out your teeth and be a white hillbilly ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 about the woman ENT_amr-unknown-1 wear short , high heel and too much make up to be a hooker ?
there have to be a stop to this forever drive to find something insensitive .
and if someone want to look for reason they be be hold back for what ever reason they have in their head , they will always find justification no matter what .
but ENT_amr-unknown-0 be we as a so call free society really jump on board this super pc behavior ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 be it now ok to find the smallest thing to be offend about and throw it out as the new discrimination ?
and ENT_amr-unknown-0 be these rule only apply to -CONST--0 or -CONST--1 race ?
NE_country-0 , white , black , green , blue , short , tall , fat..
ENT_amr-unknown-0 have you , be all be make fun of in some way when it come to costume and NE_festival-0 but only those -CONST--0 race get the red light ?
isnt that racist ?
these student be bleed idealism and have n't be temper enough with time and cultural patina to realize that one should be able to laugh at oneself and one 's cultural obsession and that these costume be n't the evil mechanism of racism they be betray them to be .
this be an absolutely ridiculous thread .
i mean if racist costume be actually be ban , you all might have a point .
i be as uptight about the plight of white people in the NE_country-0 as anyone be .
but do anyone else read the article ?
no one be ban NE_festival-0 costumes..
no one be even talk about ban NE_festival-0 costume .
in fact no one in this story want to ban anything , except for the people here who apparently want to ban poster .
these student have a simple goal .
they say "... if we can change a few people or make a few people think , then that 's awesome ".
they be n't ban anything or stop anybody from do anything .
this story be about student express free speech .
they be make poster express their opinion .
of course if you want to wear a costume that others find offensive it be free speech .
but me complain about your costume be offensive be also free speech .
neither should be ban .
and that be the way it work .
whether your costume involve black face and a noose , or whether it be a grill sandwich where i think the cheese be a little too drippy be irrelevant .
free speech be free speech and express free speech be actually opposite of the " ban " that be be allege .
you all have turn this story on it 's end .
so dear massachusetters , do she have any chance in dethrone the sit NE_political-party-0 senator , NE_person-0 ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do NE_person-0 need to be dethrone ? i kinda like him...
could NE_person-0 beat NE_person-1 ?
i 'm not sure what either of them look like , but the most brutal fight -CONST--0 ever see be a girl fight , lot of kick , scratch , and some amaze punch ( the loser have to stay home from school for almost -CONST--1 week until swell went down around her eye )
so i 'm gonna say yes
i 'm think in term of the NE_political-party-0 get -CONST--0 more NE_government-organization-0 seat .
in NE_state-0 , it would seem a lot easy task then in other NE_government-organization-0 race .
i 'm think the best thing to do be keep the few moderate NE_political-party-0 we have right where they be .
he may vote along party line for most thing but he 's reasonable when it come to represent a liberal @-@ lean constituency .
do n't know , but it sound like a real bellweather contest , do n't it ?
it would have make for some really great off year contest .
care to explain why you think he be an idiot ?
he do beat NE_person-0 rather convincingly .
he serve as a state senator for several year .
he even vote for several dem bill .
NE_person-0 be a bad candidate who run a terrible campaign - i 'll hunt around for a great article -CONST--0 read -CONST--1 year ago outline the tremendous mistake she make .
as for NE_person-0 , he have a difficult time answer question about policy in a cogent fashion .
i have see him on several occasion give answer which show that he have no real understand of the underlie issue at all , and several which be really just embarrass .
i have n't really be active in ( or even really care about ) politics until recently and i 'm really just look for other people opinion on this .
well , just tell you who i 'll vote for probably won't inform you much though right ?
ENT_amr-unknown-0 issue be important to you ?
NE_person-0 i think he have do a good job in most area ; some area he let me down , plus there be no way i would vote for a NE_political-party-0 today .
( i have a few time in the past , mostly local )
anyone who be not a NE_political-party-0 .
i think the majority of them be the reason this country have become constipate concern everything that be important .
they be willing to throw NE_country-0 under the bus in order to make NE_person-0 look bad .
ok , " and why " do add a lot , you 're right .
i 'm vote for NE_person-0 because -CONST--0 think he have do a good job in difficult circumstance , and can do much more with another term , and because -CONST--1 really worry about what any of the possible NE_political-party-0 nominee would do as president if -CONST--2 of them win .
i also would n't vote for just about any NE_political-party-0 ( especially NE_person-0 ) but i have hear some good thing about NE_person-1 , he 's about the only NE_political-party-1 that i 'm actually interested in learn more about .
my own opinion of NE_person-0 be that i 'm happy that he 's in the race , and especially in debate .
i like how he 's anti @-@ war and anti @-@ bullshit in general .
i would absolutely not want him to be president , though .
NE_person-0 have a lot of post on him , that might be a good place to start if you 're interested in learn more .
here 's his un @-@ endorsement of NE_person-0 ( he endorse him , then have ENT_ordinal-entity-0 thought ):
i read a fascinate piece in the NE_newspaper-0 today .
the author spoke about how NE_person-0 's approval rating be at a dismal low .
he apparently appear to be unable to pull NE_government-organization-0 together to accomplish much , and in the author 's opinion , it would only get worse if he get elect to a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 term .
he would like NE_person-0 to bow out for a ENT_ordinal-entity-0 term , and have NE_person-1 run for president .
he believe that NE_person-0 have the best chance of bring the country together .
i do n't know how she feel about run , but , imo , i think that it be a great idea .
she certainly have the smart , the experience , and the approval of the majority of citizen .
i think that the people on the NE_political-party-0 side of the fence , be a poor bunch .
there be not a one in the bunch who would capture the imagination of the NE_country-0 people .
the voter who will decide this election , imo be the moderate and the independent . they certainly will not vote for any of the anti @-@ gay , pro @-@ life NE_book-0 banger .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think ?
should NE_person-0 step down for the good of the country ?
should NE_person-0 run ?
NE_person-0 's time have come , and gone...
she would make her self no friend of the NE_political-party-0 by divide them and lose the black vote...
no one be go to vote for her that do not vote for NE_person-0 , and a whole lot less obama voter will vote for her...
do n't worry though..
she have enough sense to not try to run against a sit president from her own party...
best case scenario : NE_person-0 get reelected and the country continue to slide backwards even if the NE_political-party-0 gain a greater foothold of the NE_country-0 NE_government-organization-0 and increase their collective mass in the NE_country-1 NE_government-organization-1 .
worst case scenario : NE_person-0 ( any NE_political-party-0 candidate other then NE_person-1 , NE_person-2 , or NE_person-3 ) will take the election .
then that mean the NE_political-party-0 would likely further gain in NE_government-organization-0 and even the NE_government-organization-1 perhaps .
then the country slide right back into the deepest of recession .
i suspect you be wrong on the vote inclination of the moderate , and especially the one you call tea baggers .
actually , i think you be wrong on the moderate @/@ independent voter turnout , too , but i could be wrong .
i 'm expect a fairly good anti NE_person-0 turnout amongst that group .
i could accept NE_person-0 .
like NE_person-0 , i 'm not greatly impress by the NE_political-party-0 field .
not crazy about the presume NE_political-party-0 candidate either .
on the other hand , NE_person-0 step aside seem even less likely than NE_person-1 give up .
i guess that in summary , i 'm not optimistic about the future of the country for the next -CONST--0 year .
kudos to NE_state-0 ! . they realize that it 's not about just vote the party line , it 's about vote for what 's right .
@jcboy , did they actually vote for gay marriage yet ?
i 'm get a mix message with the NE_newspaper-0
@tsarstepan , they sure do !
hopefully , other state will realize gay marriage hurt nobody .
look at NE_state-0 . they have have it since -CONST--0 .
have you hear of their society fall apart ? of course not .
i think with NE_state-0 , then NE_state-1 , it will rapidly spread across the country .
you can n't stop this train !
@jcboy , i hope that the us NE_government-organization-0 address this issue soon and just make the whole state by state journey moot by make same sex marriage a national law .
@jcboy , you be correct .
whether one 's home state will recognize a same sex marriage from out of state be another matter .
when i study the NE_law-0 of NE_state-0 , i think it be a damn indignity for a ENT_government-organization-0 to give permission to citizen to marry .
the citizen create the damn ENT_government-organization-0 , their child . NE_person-0
did you guy hear about that plane crash that crash into a helicopter ?
i have no idea how that happen .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do you think ?
that be a congest airway , and when you fly under -CONST--0 feet you have no aid from air traffic controller .
accident happen , but this particular area may need additional regulation ( such as a minimum altitude requirement for the tourist helicopter ) .
my husband , our kid , and myself be spend -CONST--0 day out by the oceanside with another couple and their kid , our long @-@ ENT_temporal-quantity-0 friend .
at some point we come across a huge fallen tree , and our friend NE_person-0 climb on it and start walk up .
our -CONST--0 year @-@ old son follow him , but NE_person-0 suddenly realize they won't be able to get down that easily .
he turn back and ask our son to get away and down to give him room to get down , too .
our son stop but do n't get out of his way at once .
he be have fun , and we have to tell him -CONST--0 more time , and then he obey .
after that NE_person-0 get back down , and he suddenly grab our son from behind and throw him on the ground with all his might , yell at him .
we be stupefy .
a -CONST--0 lbs -CONST--1 year old man could have easily injure him .
fortunately he get up unscathed albeit very frighten .
we be in deep shock , we never hit our children .
do anybody know if there be legal way to teach the man a lesson - but not monetary ?
be there any point in file a police report ?
personally , if someone be my friend , i be go to deal with the situation on a person to person level .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 can n't you make it sure that you be really upset and that you do n't want them hit your kid ever again .
legally , there be -CONST--0 remedy .
there be monetary damage , and there be jail time .
i suppose you could add probation ( but that be just a replacement for jail time ) .
if you go the legal route , that pretty much end the friendship no matter what happen .
if i be angry enough to start down this path i would n't worry about where it end up .
i would probably express my feeling on the situation and make it clear that it be not to happen again .
your son be assault .
that be what the behaviour of your ex @-@ friend would be name legally .
he do n't hurt your child physically , so it be the lesser form of assault ( assault cause physical harm be see as more serious.)
you certainly could file a police report....
i do n't know the law where you be , here , it be quite likely that police would go around and question the man , make it clear that ( if your description be accurate ) he have commit an offence , but you could decide against file charge .
again , depending on where you live , you could likely notyify child protection authority .
here , be extra @-@ familial , and give that you have already decide not to expose your child to hm again , they would simply hand it to police .
if you release a legal genie from the bottle , though , you lose control of what the genie do .
for instance , you and your son would need to make a formal statement .
it might be that police act even if you do n't want them to .
it might go to court .
i 'd personally not choose to do it tthat way...though you could certainly chat to local police without name name and see if there be such a thing as a stern chat , or a formal caution to be have in your area .
i 'd hope that a stern talk from you and the loss of the friendship would be a big message to him .
however , my concern would be how he treat his own kid .
that be one hell of an over @-@ reaction .
if you have evidence that he assault his own kid , i 'd be consider a chold protection notification .
be your kid ok ?
that would have be scary .
be he have nightmare or anything ?
i 'd also be have a chat with him about his behaviour .
it do n't warrant such a reaction , but he be thoughtless .
if it be really unusual behaviour from your friend , i be a bit worry about him , too , frankly .
i be a -CONST--0 year old woman , and i have be in a -CONST--1 year relationship with a -CONST--2 year old married man .
he have -CONST--0 kid -CONST--1 , from his marriage and -CONST--2 from a previous relationship .
he have be plan to get a divorce since the ENT_ordinal-entity-0 day we meet ,
thing be so heat between us , i do n't know what to do .
he be plan on move out of the house by the end of the year , he and his wife do not see eye to eye .
he be have sex chat with a lady he meet on NE_product-0 from NE_country-0 ,
when i find out it affect me really badly .
i feel and still feel betray and i can n't trust him .
ENT_amr-unknown-0 do i let go ?
@jeje , you just walk away .
do you really think so little of yourself that you believe this be the best you can do ?
a marry man who if he really be in love with you would just go ahead and file for divorce now , or at least move out of his house now .
a man who while have a relationship with you be involve in sex chat online with others .
personally , when you mess with a married man you deserve exactly what you get .
i have little or no pity for you .
but , you can do yourself a world of good by just walk away from him .
then ENT_amr-unknown-0 do n't you think about look for someone ENT_amr-unknown-1 be not attach .
your odds of find happiness be a bit better go that route in my opinion .
