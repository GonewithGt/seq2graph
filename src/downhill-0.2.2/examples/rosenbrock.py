        A sequence of results from running tests. Each result contains a "key"
        that describes the test run and a "value" that contains the results from
        the run. The key is a tuple containing (a) the algorithm, (b) the
        learning rate, (c) the momentum, (d) the RMS halflife, and (e) the RMS
        regularizer. The value is a tuple containing the (a) x-values and (b)
        y-values during the optimization, and (c) the loss value. (The x- and
        y-value are only non-empty for 2D experiments.)
